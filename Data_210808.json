The bug is tracked as CVE-2021-3490. It was disclosed in May and is a privilege escalation, so leveraging it requires local access on the target machine. eBPF is a technology that enables user-supplied programs to run sandboxed inside the operating system’s kernel, triggered by a specific event or function (e.g. system call, network events).  of the   CTF team working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported the bug. They found that CVE-2021-3490 could be turned into out-of-bounds reads and writes in the kernel. The issue consists of the fact that user-supplied programs do not go through a proper validation process before they’re executed. If properly exploited, a local attacker could get kernel privileges to run arbitrary code on the machine.

Her research into this bug also covers the specifics for triggering the vulnerability to leverage it for elevated privileges and to create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the target system by locking up all available kernel threads.

The use-after-free vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22930 is to do with how HTTP2 streams are handled in the language. This week Node.js has pushed out fixes for high severity, use-after-free vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22930. Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program tries to access a resource at a memory address that has been previously freed and no longer holds the resource. This can lead to data corruption, or unexpected behaviors such as application crashes, or even remote code execution (RCE) in some cases. The fixes landed in the latest Node.js release 16.6.0 and were also backported to versions 12.22.4 (LTS) and 14.17.4 (LTS). The fix shown below has been applied across multiple Node.js branches to squash the use-after-free vulnerability:  has been credited with reporting this vulnerability. The abrupt update release for a high severity vulnerability is explained by the fact discussions around the vulnerability were already public: \"We normally like to give advance notice and provide releases in which the only changes are security fixes, but since this vulnerability was already public we felt it was more important to get this fix out fast in releases that were already planned,\"   Red Hat principal software engineer and NodeJS Technical Steering Committee (TSC) member Daniel Bevenius. The vulnerability was triggered in cases where Node.js parsed incoming RST_STREAM frames, with no error code or a cancel code. In applications based on the  , RST_STREAM frame is sent by either host intending to terminate a connection. For example, in a client-server architecture, if a client application wants to end the connection, it would send an RST_STREAM frame to the server. On receiving the frame, the server will cease responding to the client, eventually aborting the connection. Any \"DATA\" frames which the server was about to send to the client, could then be discarded. But in the case of vulnerable Node.js versions, when an RST_STREAM frame was received by the server with a \"cancel\" code ( ), the receiver would try to \"force purge\" any data received. And, once this was done, an automatic callback would additionally run the \"close\" function, attempting to free up the memory a second time—which had already been freed in the last step. And, this would result in an application crash, or erratic behavior due to a double-free error. This error—previously thought of as a \"bug\" rather than an exploitable vulnerability, was reported on June 8th, 2021 by Matthew Douglass on a  . Douglass was able to reproduce the bug 100% of the time on his system, resulting in application crashes. The discussion ensued for well over a month between Douglass and Node.js contributors: \"The issue seems to be because of the handling of the RST_STREAM frame received with no error code and cancel error code.\" \"The node tries to force process it and purge any existing data for the stream. This causes   to close the already destroyed stream causing the double-free error,\" responded GitHub user  The fix rolled out instead adds the incoming stream of RST_STREAM frames to a queue and processes the queue once it is safe to do so. This would prevent any double-free or use-after-free errors. Node.js users should upgrade to the latest version 16.6.0, or a patched backported version. This won't matter if your node app only serves http 1.1 and a reverse proxy on the frontend, such as Nginx, is what serves http2 to the client. Correct? Why has Ubuntu marked this as \"low\" priority? It's a critical flaw that especially affects servers running node to do their daily business. They have not released a fix. Not a member yet?

Read our   to learn what content is prohibited.Node.js has released updates for a high severity vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to corrupt the process and cause unexpected behaviors, such as application crashes and potentially remote code execution (RCE). The use-after-free vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22930 is to do with how HTTP2 streams are handled in the language. This week Node.js has pushed out fixes for high severity, use-after-free vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22930. Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program tries to access a resource at a memory address that has been previously freed and no longer holds the resource. This can lead to data corruption, or unexpected behaviors such as application crashes, or even remote code execution (RCE) in some cases. The fixes landed in the latest Node.js release 16.6.0 and were also backported to versions 12.22.4 (LTS) and 14.17.4 (LTS).

Mitchell Schneider, principal research analyst at Gartner, says, \"The opportunity that Ivanti and RiskSense have taken advantage of is to enrich the threat topology with insight from both the threat and the endpoint management perspective to improve visibility into an organization's threat context.\" Sophos' acquisition of Refactr was completed with the intention of optimizing Refactr's DevSecOps automation platform to add security orchestration automation and response, or SOAR, capabilities to Sophos' managed threat response and extended detection and response solutions, the company says.  \"As we've seen in recent supply chain incidents, attackers are increasingly targeting software development pipelines, and defenders need the ability to shift further left of attackers. The industry needs SOAR to mature into more capable and generalizable DevSecOps solutions,\" says Joe Levy, chief technology officer at Sophos.  “With this acquisition, Sophos continues to build on its adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem platform that combines software, hardware and services from their own stable with an open technology alliance program for third-party integrations,” says Paul Webber,  a senior research director with Gartner.  This deal comes on the heels of Sophos' July 23 purchase of  .  Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory's acquisition of aeCyberSolutions from Greenville, South Carolina-based Applied Engineering Solutions is intended to bolster Deloitte's cybersecurity offerings for industrial control systems and operational technology security, the company says.  This acquisition marks the fifth deal announced by Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory this year. In addition, Deloitte Consulting acquired the systems engineering and cybersecurity firm Sentek Consulting on July 23. Cerberus Sentinel said that VelocIT will become a wholly owned subsidiary, continuing its focus on providing integrated risk managed services.  VelocIT President Darek Hahn and COO Glenn Kupsch will take on executive positions with Cerberus Sentinel.  Feedzai portrays its purchase of Revelock as a first step toward building a financial intelligence network. \r\n The company seeks to tie Feedzai's Risk Ledger, which consists of 150 billion data points that are aggregated from previous financial transactions, to Revelock's biometric intelligence that's gathered from users, devices and sessions connecting to a system. It will use these two technologies to help determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Olenick has covered the cybersecurity and computer technology sectors for more than 25 years.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing came just weeks after the White House joined the European Union and NATO allies in attributing the recent campaign that exploited flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers to Chinese state-sponsored attackers (see:  ). According to testimony at the hearing, the FBI estimates that China steals $300 billion to $600 billion worth of U.S. intellectual property each year. And the U.S. Department of Justice says 60% of all trade secret theft cases have some nexus to China (see:  ). China is stealing IP through espionage campaigns to support its efforts to dominate technology development, such as for artificial intelligence and semiconductors, senators and those testifying said. Then, in turn, China could leverage the use of this technology worldwide for espionage. Plus, the Chinese Communist Party is conducting \"influence operations\" targeting policymakers, businesses and academic institutions in hopes of sowing dissent in the U.S. and potentially hampering a response to its intelligence operations, according to lawmakers and experts testifying. To deal with the threats posed by China, experts who testified recommended several steps, including: ramping up domestic tech manufacturing to curtail the reliance on Chinese tech, updating legislation on foreign agent tracking and creating a public-private information-sharing organization to monitor Chinese cyber and physical threats. \"To effectively defend against China, we must put the same effort into this threat as we did to combat terrorism the past 20 years,\" said Bill Evanina, former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. \"I would suggest [this China cyberthreat] is much more dangerous to our economic and military viability as a nation.\" The People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party are \"working to acquire critical U.S. technologies, intellectual property, hack into the U.S. cyber networks and conduct influence operations to shape narratives that are more favorable to the PRC,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chairman of the committee. The Chinese Communist Party is using cyberespionage to acquire technological capabilities, he said. And by hoarding intellectual property, China hopes to \"ensure their future dominance\" in several key areas, including AI, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, biotech, data analytics and semiconductors, he added. Warner said the government's recent efforts to limit the use of equipment from the Chinese firms   on U.S. 5G networks are necessary to help protect national security because the equipment could be used for spying. Addressing China's theft of intellectual property, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., vice chairman of the committee, added, \"Today, China is carrying out the biggest illegal wealth transfer from one nation to another in the history of mankind.\" Evanina, formerly of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, testified: \"The holistic and comprehensive threat to the U.S. posed by the Communist Party of China is an existential threat and is the most complex, pernicious, aggressive and strategic threat our nation has ever faced. [Chinese President] Xi Jinping has one goal: to be the geopolitical military and economic leader in the world, period.\" China possesses \"persistent and unending\" cybersecurity resources to penetrate U.S. systems and exfiltrate data or to plant malware on critical infrastructure for future use, Evanina warned. \"It's unnecessary for China to procure or buy [sensitive] data when they can come in and take it for free because of our lack of cybersecurity defenses,\" he testified. \"We provide an open door for them to take their spear-phishing or use other vectors to get into our systems and take our DNA and genomics data.\" If the U.S. loses its \"technological edge\" to China, that would have \"far-reaching implications,\" said Anna Puglisi, senior fellow at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. In her testimony, Puglisi described Chinese efforts to create and coordinate global \"talent programs\" to recruit specialists for intelligence gathering or for conducting cyber offensives. Matthew Pottinger, distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former deputy national security adviser for the White House, testified: \"Assembling dossiers on people has always been a feature of Leninist regimes, but Beijing's penetration of digital networks worldwide, including using 5G networks, has really taken this to a new level.\" Pottinger told senators the Communist Party compiles dossiers on millions of foreign citizens using material it gathers via cyberattacks and other means and uses that information to support social engineering campaigns to influence public officials as well as consumers. China has flooded U.S. social media platforms with overt and covert propaganda amplified by proxies and bots - all to exacerbate social tensions within the U.S., he said. Pottinger told the committee that synthetic biology, 5G networks and machine learning are all built on advanced semiconductors, and China dominates chip manufacturing. \"I believe that we need to provide subsidies to bring back a certain amount of the manufacturing of semiconductors to the U.S.,\" Pottinger testified.

Speaking at the   on Wednesday, Neuberger defended the administration's response to cyberthreats posed by China and Russia as well as several high-profile ransomware attacks that have targeted U.S. critical infrastructure over the last several months. Neuberger, who has shaped the White House's response to many of these cyber incidents over the last eight months, pointed not only to the administration calling out Russia over the   supply chain attack and highlighting China's role in the attacks on vulnerable Exchange email servers, but also the   signed by President Joe Biden that looks to modernize the federal government's cybersecurity protections, including how software is purchased and used. \"You saw in the executive order a key component, in which we said that the U.S. government will only buy technology that is built in accordance with software security standards,\" Neuberger said. \"And clearly that doesn't just benefit the federal government. … By having the federal government define the standards and saying we'll use the power of our procurement to move the market there, this will benefit small and large businesses and individuals alike.\" When the Biden administration in July formally accused China's Ministry of State Security, aka MSS, of carrying out a series of attacks earlier this year against vulnerable on-premises Microsoft Exchange, several cybersecurity experts expressed concern that the U.S. did not impose sanctions (see:  ). One reason to hold off sanctions, however, is that the Biden administration is attempting to build a consensus among nations on how to confront China over its malicious cyber activity, Neuberger said. She noted that the   indicted four members of the MSS for their roles in other cyber campaigns. \"The Microsoft Exchange attack … emphasizes the Biden administration approach to not go at it alone, but instead to use a sequential, thoughtful approach and to bring partners along to establish those norms of accepted behavior in cyberspace,\" Neuberger said. The administration had previously sanctioned   and the government's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, for its role in the supply chain attack against SolarWinds, which led to follow-on attacks on about 100 companies and nine federal agencies. Neuberger said that Russia had a history of aggressive cyber behavior not only against the U.S. but other countries as well. \"This was not the first case of aggressive Russian cyber activity in the international space and we have seen a series of activities in Ukraine, Georgia, Germany and other parts of Europe as well,\" Neuberger noted. \"And there's a broader consensus around the need to call out [Russia's] bad behavior.\" When asked about the types of measures the Biden administration is taking in response to aggressive cyber campaigns, Neuberger pointed to the president directly confronting Russia and China over their behavior. She also pointed to new U.S. investments in cyber defenses for   to help ensure it can withstand attacks. \"The U.S. government is making efforts to modernize our defenses and to launch innovative critical infrastructure resilience efforts,\" Neuberger noted. \"We have made a massive push to say that we must address our poor level of national cyber resilience. In no small part, this is underpinned by the fact that critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector and we must encourage, incentivize and move the private sector to make the investment needed to ensure that we as a country can guarantee those critical services.\" Neuberger was less forthcoming on how the U.S. might use offensive cyber operations. She noted more aggressive steps can escalate quickly, especially considering the interconnectivity of many IT networks. \"One must always consider the interoperability of networks,\" Neuberger said. \"Having a discrete impact, having confidence in that discrete impact, is often challenging, given how much networks are interconnected within countries and globally.\" The Biden administration is also continuing to develop strategies to counter ransomware attacks, especially in the light of attacks on   and meat processor  . Ransomware was the topic at the center of the June summit meeting between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, two of the ransomware gangs believed responsible for some of these attacks - DarkSide and REvil - have gone quiet, although these groups may have started rebranding under new names (see:  ). In an interview this week with  , a threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future, someone claiming to be an administrator with the new ransomware group BlackMatter said that the gang would not attack critical infrastructure, but other companies would be fair game. Neuberger said she took that as a sign that the Biden administration's stance and the meeting with Putin might have had some effect on these gangs, although it's impossible to take the word of a supposed cybercriminal at face value. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" she said. A more surefire way to disrupt ransomware is to attack the cybercriminals' business model, which includes disrupting their operations and adopting new cryptocurrency regulations, Neuberger said. \"If we want to disrupt ransomware ... we need to be able to rapidly trace and interdict [cryptocurrency payments] around the world, and there's a lot of lessons learned from physical know-your-customer and anti-money laundering global efforts that we're working to apply here,\" Neuberger noted.

But patches are now available.   So far, there is no evidence these flaws have been exploited, a Forescout spokesperson says. On Thursday, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an   describing the vulnerabilities, saying users and administrators should review the   and apply the necessary updates and mitigations. NicheStack is a proprietary TCP/IP stack developed by InterNiche Technologies in 1996 and now offered by the company HCC Embedded. Users of the stack include many OT device and critical infrastructure providers and vendors, including Emerson, Honeywell, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Rockwell Automation. The flaws - which the researchers named \"INFRA:HALT\" - have the potential \"to cause even more widespread disruption at a time when we’re already seeing an increased number of attacks against multiple global utility, oil and gas, healthcare and supply chain organizations,” says Daniel dos Santos, research manager at Forescout Research Labs. “We urge organizations to take protective measures against INFRA:HALT, which requires limiting the network exposure of critical vulnerable devices via network segmentation and patching devices when vendors release patches.” HCC recommends users apply release v4.3, which contains patches to fix the issue. NicheStack is one of four embedded TCP/IP protocol stacks developed by InterNiche Technologies and now sold by HCC Embedded. It's used to connect embedded devices, such as the Siemens S7 line of PLCs. The IP layer in NicheStack is manually configurable and thus can be used as a client machine, an IP router or a multi-homed server. The vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to carry out a variety of malicious activities. The researchers say that two of the flaws,   and  , could enable attackers to gain remote code execution privileges, which the researchers explained with a theoretical example as shown in the figure below: As illustrated, an attacker could send a specially crafted DNS request to the INTER:HALT vulnerable device. This malicious request consists of a shellcode that instructs Device 1 to send a malicious FTP packet to Device 2 on the same network, which in this example is assumed to be a programmable logic controller. The malicious FTP packet, in turn, causes the PLC to crash and ultimately leads to a complete failure of all further processes. A search on the   search engine by Forescout showed that more than 6,400 devices are running NicheStack protocol, of which 6,360 run an HTTP server. But Santos says more devices run the stack. \"Since many of the affected devices are in operational technology, they should, by definition, not be accessible over the internet. Those 6,400 are mostly in misconfigured networks,\" he says. Some 4,000 devices found in the Shodan search were in North America. The researchers said that their own database classified over 2,500 devices from 21 vendors across the globe that used NicheStack protocol. Use of the NicheStack protocol is mainly associated with industrial control systems, including in the retail and manufacturing sectors, the researchers say.  HCC Embedded released patches in May 2021 as part of version 4.3. Other mitigation steps that Santos suggests network engineers and device vendors follow are: Bagwe previously worked at CISO magazine, reporting the latest cybersecurity news and trends and interviewing cybersecurity subject matter experts. \n                                                              Covering topics in risk management, compliance, fraud, and information security.

Participants in the JCDC will include federal agencies, state and local officials, owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure, and academics and security researchers, she said.   Besides the JDCD announcement,  , whom the Senate approved as CISA director last month, called for greater collaboration between security researchers and white hat hackers. \"We know that with great power comes great responsibility,\" Easterly said. \"One of my big priorities as a director is to ensure that we are maximizing this power and that is to cultivate and strengthen the incredible partnerships that we have - in particular with industry, with academia, with researchers within the hacker community - and to ensure that we are leveraging the best and brightest of this community for the collective defense of the nation.\" Easterly said the JCDC will perform several functions, including: \"To some extent, some of these activities are already going on across the federal government, but they're running largely in stovepipes. So the idea is that we bring together our partners in the government and our private sector partners to really mature this planning capability,\" Easterly said. Besides CISA and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security, other federal government participants will include the U.S. National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command and the FBI. Easterly announced nine companies have signed up to participate,: CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. The JCDC will build on the relationships CISA has with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or ISACs, which represent various industries. The concept for the new initiative came from the  , which published its report in 2020 (see:  ). Tom Kellermann, the head of cybersecurity strategy for VMware and a member of the Cyber Investigations Advisory Board for the U.S. Secret Service, says the newly announced JCDC is a major milestone in beefing up U.S. cybersecurity. \"The collaborative will spearhead a long overdue effort to civilize American cyberspace,\" Kellermann says. \"It will dramatically improve situational awareness to systemic cyber intrusions and enhance coordination to respond and eradicate the persistence of our Cold War adversaries.\" Easterly, who succeeded   as CISA director, is taking over the agency at a time when the federal government has been dealing with a series of cyberthreats. Those include nation-state attacks, such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability exploits, and also cybercriminals' ransomware campaigns (see:  ).  recently signed an executive memorandum calling for uniform cybersecurity standards across industries that oversee critical infrastructure. In her Black Hat conference presentation, Easterly said that the proliferation of ransomware attacks, especially those that target critical sectors, such as the  , show why the new JCDC collaborative effort is essential. \"Our two initial focus areas - the first one will not surprise you - is our effort to combat ransomware. The second one is our effort to develop a planning framework to respond to cyber incidents on cloud providers,\" Easterly said. The White House is seeking additional funding for cybersecurity to shore up cyber defenses (see:  ). One of the reasons the Biden administration nominated Easterly for CISA director is her long experience in cybersecurity, which she described during her Black Hat keynote presentation. Easterly retired as an Army intelligence officer in 2011 and was then named as deputy for counterterrorism at the NSA. She later served on President Obama's National Security Council staff. After leaving the government, Easterly worked as Morgan Stanley's head of firm resilience and oversaw the company's fusion resilience center. While in the Army, Easterly worked with Gen. Keith Alexander, who was then director of the NSA, to help establish U.S. Cyber Command. During a brief Q&A session, Easterly said that one of her main objectives as director is to build trust between CISA and the research and hacking communities. She received applause for coming out in favor of strong encryption, despite other government agencies' objections (see:  ). \"We have to have strong encryption to be able to ensure the defense of our networks. It's foundational, as everybody in this audience knows,\" Easterly said. \"I realize that there are other points of view across the government. … I think strong encryption is absolutely fundamental for us to be able to do what we need to do.\" Ferguson is the managing editor for the GovInfoSecurity.com media website at Information Security Media Group.

The system, called CSAM Detection, is designed to catch offensive material that's uploaded to iCloud accounts from devices. It works partially on a device itself - a detail that privacy and security experts say could open a door to broader monitoring of devices.  \"I don’t particularly want to be on the side of child porn and I’m not a terrorist,\" tweets  , a cryptographer who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University. \"But the problem is that encryption is a powerful tool that provides privacy, and you can’t really have strong privacy while also surveilling every image anyone sends.\"  The system will be implemented later this year in iOS 15, watchOS and macOS Monterey, which is the next desktop iteration. The   reports that it will only apply to U.S. devices.  \"CSAM detection will help Apple provide valuable information to law enforcement on collections of CSAM in iCloud Photos,\" Apple says on its  . \"This program is ambitious, and protecting children is an important responsibility. These efforts will evolve and expand over time.\"  Apple is also tweaking its Messages app to address explicit content either sent or received by children. Messages will use machine learning to automatically analyze image attachments and blur content that is sexually explicit. That will happen on the device, and Apple says it does not have access to the content. Apple will also display different types of warning messages, including to parents.  \"When receiving this type of content, the photo will be blurred and the child will be warned, presented with helpful resources and reassured it is okay if they do not want to view this photo,\" Apple says.  Apple's CSAM Detection system flags abusive images before they're uploaded to iCloud. The system uses a database of known abusive material compiled by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Apple renders that database into a set of unreadable hashes using a system called NeuralHash. Images are converted into a unique number that is specific to the image. The list is then uploaded and securely stored on a user's device. The system makes it virtually impossible for someone to figure out what images would trigger a positive detection. Apple says it can also detect what is essentially the same image but with slightly different attributes.  \"Only another image that appears nearly identical can produce the same number; for example, images that differ in size or transcoded quality will still have the same NeuralHash value,\" according to an Apple  .  Apple says it's using a technique called private set intersection, or PSI, to detect photos with CSAM content and also ensure other photos remain private.  If the system detects enough matches for CSAM content, Apple will review the material and in some cases, a user's account may be disabled and a report sent to the NCMEC.  Apple says the system preserves users' privacy in that it doesn't see images that lack a match with the CSAM database. It's not entirely clear why Apple has chosen to do part of the analysis on users' devices, which some security experts find concerning.  iCloud backups are unencrypted and easy game for law enforcement agencies. There's no reason why Apple can't do CSAM scanning on the material once it has been uploaded from a device, which is already done by other cloud storage providers.  Green   the system's design may be part of an effort to perform broader device scanning, even for files not shared with iCloud and possibly also content that is encrypted end to end.  But ask yourself: why would Apple spend so much time and effort designing a system that is *specifically* designed to scan images that exist (in plaintext) only on your phone — if they didn’t eventually plan to use it for data that you don’t share in plaintext with Apple? From there, it may be a slippery slope, Green contends. Apple has \"sent a very clear signal. In their (very influential) opinion, it is safe to build systems that scan users’ phones for prohibited content. That’s the message they’re sending to governments, competing services, China, you,\" he  .  But Apple's website features three assessments of CSAM Detection from cryptography and security experts who endorsed the system.  \"In conclusion, I believe that the Apple PSI system provides an excellent balance between privacy and utility, and will be extremely helpful in identifying CSAM content while maintaining a high level of user privacy and keeping false positives to a minimum,\" writes Benny Pinkas of the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, in a  .

According to just one report, 7.9 billion records were exposed in the first nine months of 2019. This compounds the burden on already stretched IT teams who are tasked with tackling the daily challenges precipitated by shadow IT, cloud computing, containers, zero-trust, and software-defined everything.  And what do most observers see as the common culprit for all of this chaos? Visibility gaps. To find out more about the challenges that organizations face, Tanium commissioned independent market-research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey 750 IT decision makers across the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, and Canada.

NSA explains why it's so risky to access public Wi-Fi networks from laptops, tablets, mobile phones and wearable accessories. \"Cyber actors employ malicious access points, redirect to malicious websites, inject malicious proxies and eavesdrop on network traffic,\" the agency warns. It also cautions against the public use of Bluetooth and Near Field Communications. \"The risk is not merely theoretical; these malicious techniques are publicly known and in use.\" A reminder about the dangers of using public Wi-Fi is important in light of the shift to a remote workforce, says John Dickson, a former member of the U.S. Air Force's Information Warfare Center and its Computer Emergency Response Team. \"In a pandemic, more Defense Department, defense contractors and other industry partners are working remotely,\" he says. \"The potential risk of Wi-Fi exploitation against these workers - particularly outside the country and in the Capitol region - is acute. There is no downside to formally restating these protections.\" Dickson, now the vice president of security firm Coalfire, says the NSA's tips are helpful for workers in all sectors. The NSA advises: \"Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi, when possible, as there is an increased risk when using public Wi-Fi networks. Use a corporate or personal Wi-Fi hot spot with strong authentication and encryption whenever possible, as it will be more secure.\"\r\n The NSA adds: \"If users choose to connect to public Wi-Fi, they must take precautions. Data sent over public Wi-Fi - especially open public Wi-Fi that does not require a password to access - is vulnerable to theft or manipulation. Even if a public Wi-Fi network requires a password, it might not encrypt traffic going over it. If the Wi-Fi network does encrypt the\r\ndata, malicious actors can decrypt it if they know the pre-shared key.\" Threat actors can also coerce the network into using unsecure protocols or obsolete encryption algorithms, the agency says. And they can set up a fake access point, known as an \"evil twin,\" to mimic nearby public Wi-Fi and gain access to data. The intelligence agency also says unencrypted or easily decrypted network traffic can be captured using readily available open-source tools, leading to credential harvesting and additional compromises. The NSA also advises users to practice proper browsing habits - including accessing only Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure sites. \"These methods will aid users in better protecting their information from Wi-Fi snooping, man-in-the-middle techniques, server masquerades used to capture password hashes and evil twin mimics,\" the agency says. Keeping Bluetooth enabled in public settings can lead to threat actors scanning for, and ultimately accessing or compromising, devices via Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing and Bluebugging, the NSA points out. Near Field Communications, which offers close device-to-device data transfers, can also be exploited at close range, the agency adds. \"While the majority of NSA's guidance focuses on Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth are likely riskier areas,\" warns Jake Williams, a former member of NSA's elite hacking team. \"The attack surfaces of NFC and Bluetooth have not been studied as much as Wi-Fi, and there are likely more undiscovered vulnerabilities in those protocols.\" Williams, co-founder and CTO at security firm BreachQuest, argues that avoiding the use of public Wi-Fi \"is not realistic for most.\" He adds: \"With the rise of ubiquitous encryption, particularly the use of HTTPS, the risks of using public Wi-Fi today are a fraction of what they were even a few years ago. Security practitioners should … be communicating the relative risks of using public Wi-Fi with a laptop versus a cellphone or tablet.\" Laptops, he says, use host-name technologies, such as Link-Local Muliticast Name Resolution, or LLMNR, which make using public Wi-Fi even riskier.

The attackers' unusual techniques point to the need for organizations to ramp up defenses against these types of attacks, which eventually could target employees' credentials.  Researchers at the   says they \"observed a phish using a rather unorthodox tactic of acquiring PayPal credentials.\" The researchers found that the campaign not only creates a typical “forms” page or spoofed logins, but also uses a carefully crafted email that appears to be legitimate unless a recipient dives into the headers and links. The subject line notes that the email is trying to initiate a live chat to discuss a service notice related to the target’s PayPal account. \"This may rush the target into attempting to have the problem resolved quickly. Despite this, the threat actor made no attempts at masking the “from” address, which the PDC [Primary Domain Controller - a service in a Windows server that manages security for its local domain] identified as one that’s not associated with legitimate PayPal emails,\" says Alex Geoghagan, security researcher at Cofense Phishing Defense Center. The malicious email also contains a “Help & Contact” link as well as a “Learn to Identify Phishing” link, both leading to authentic PayPal links. But, Geoghagan notes, \"when hovering over the button labelled “Confirm Your Account,” it does not lead to a PayPal URL. It instead leads to a URL at direct[.]lc[.]chat. A user familiar with PayPal may notice at this point that they are being taken to a domain outside of PayPal, while the legitimate PayPal live chat is hosted within the PayPal domain and requires that you log in to use it.\" When a victim visits the fraudulent live chat, the threat actor utilizes automated scripts to start communication. The attacker initially attempts to get an email address and phone number from the victim. \"It can safely be assumed that the threat actor is gathering this information to convey legitimacy or to collect sufficient information for authentication,\" according to the Cofense report. \"The attacker will continue to use this automated script, and then step in where the script fails in order to directly interact with the victim. This is probably to reduce their own workload throughout the attack,\" Geoghagan states. Once the threat actor acquires the phone number and an attempt to verify the email address has been made, the attackers then will try to get credit card information from the target, the Cofense report notes. \"Finally, a verification code is sent via SMS to the target using the phone number provided earlier. By using this code, it can be inferred that the phone number given by the victim is live and the target is the individual who has access to the device,\" the researchers note. \"After acquiring the right amount of information from the target, the threat actor will supposedly attempt to call their target. However, as they stated, they will only call the target if they are able to verify the entirety of information given to them.\" Nair is principal correspondent for Information Security Media Group's global news desk.

In 2019, San Francisco-based mobile game developer Zynga suffered a data breach that exposed users' personal details, including email addresses, passwords and some phone numbers and Facebook IDs. As a result, the company faced four class action lawsuits. But last week, a judge ordered that the case be thrown out, although she has left open the door for plaintiffs to amend their complaint. \"The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and grants the motion to dismiss for lack of standing with leave to amend,\" U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her Friday  . Her reasoning: Users whose data was exposed agreed to terms and conditions specifying that any disagreements would be resolved via arbitration, and they also haven't been able to prove they suffered any financial harm from the breach. Founded in 2007, publicly traded Zynga is known for games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends, a popular multiplayer word game that is similar to the classic board game Scrabble. Earlier this year, the company said it had 164 million monthly active users. On Sept. 12, 2019, Zynga warned customers that it had suffered a data breach (see:  ).  \"Cyberattacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,\" the company's initial data breach notification stated. \"We recently discovered that certain player account information may have been illegally accessed by outside hackers. An investigation was immediately commenced, leading third-party forensics firms were retained to assist, and we have contacted law enforcement.\" As   reported at the time, a prolific Pakistani hacker known as Gnosticplayers claimed to be behind the attack, resulting in the theft of customer account information for more than 218 million users of Words With Friends. \"Hundreds of millions of people, including plaintiffs, trusted and believed Zynga's promise to protect their personally identifying information,\" reads the latest consolidated class action complaint filed on March 12 against Zynga, which includes 27 counts - or causes for action. \"Yet despite its promise, Zynga failed to protect its customers' PII by, among other things, using outdated password encryption methods that were banned for use by federal governmental agencies as early as 2010.\" That's a reference to the site having stored some passwords using the SHA-1 algorithm, which even at that time was an outdated approach that was relatively easy for hackers to crack. Many security experts have long warned organizations to not use SHA-1, but rather to use a fit for purpose password-hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt. Zynga has continued to argue in court that the lawsuit should be moved to arbitration. After the consolidated class action was filed on April 27, Zynga again made a motion to compel arbitration for part of the claims, as well as to dismiss the other parts of the lawsuit, asserting that they had no Article III standing and also failed to state a claim. Seeing lawsuits get filed by U.S. residents after their personal details get exposed in a data breach is common. But so, too, is seeing those lawsuits get dismissed after judges rule that the \"plaintiffs' bar\" - the group of attorneys representing plaintiffs - failed to prove that victims suffered an actual or threatened injury, under what's known as Article III standing, legal experts say (see:  ). In cases in which financial information, such as bank account or credit card numbers, has been exposed, the relevant financial services firms will often directly reimburse any losses. In some cases, courts have allowed lawsuits to proceed because of the identity theft threat posed by exposed information. When that happens, defendants typically agree to settle a case, rather than risk a jury imposing an unexpected penalty and an unfavorable precedent being set (see:  ). Following the breach notification, a Zynga spokeswoman declined to tell Information Security Media Group what types of data were exposed. But Gnosticplayers told The Hacker News that compromised Zynga information included: The plaintiffs also alleged that \"credit card information and other personally identifying information\" might have been exposed, and that approximately \"172 [million] to 218 million user records\" in total appear to have been compromised. As a result of financial information allegedly having been exposed, the plaintiffs said that \"since the Zynga data breach, Zynga's customers have been exposed to credit and identity theft, 'credit stuffing,' phishing scams and other illegal and fraudulent conduct perpetrated by the criminal actors who have come into possession of the stolen PII, either through purchase of the same on the dark web or through the theft of the PII during the data breach itself.\" The lawsuit says some of the victims included minors, and notes that Zynga offered no credit monitoring services to victims following the breach. The judge, however, wasn't convinced that the data breach victims faced any actual financial damage. As a result, the Zynga case appears set to move in a different direction: to arbitration. This typically involves a former judge agreeing to hear both sides and then issuing a legally binding decision, although this can sometimes be appealed to another arbitrator. In her order, Rogers wrote that the plaintiffs had agreed to Zynga's 2019 terms and conditions, which included an arbitration agreement, and found that the plaintiffs had entered no valid challenge against that clause. She upheld Zynga's motion to dismiss this part of the complaint, although she gave the plaintiffs time to amend their complaint. In terms of damages, \"the court finds that, as currently pled, the complaint fails to establish a sufficiently concrete injury-in-fact as required for Article III standing,\" Rogers wrote. \"Specifically, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an invasion of privacy or a risk of future harm based on the information allegedly stolen in the breach.\" Accordingly, she upheld Zynga's motion to dismiss this part of the lawsuit based on lack of Article III standing, although she again gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint. As that indicates, the case isn't over yet. Plaintiffs have until Aug. 27 to file an amended complaint, and Zynga has until Sept. 20 to respond. \"Should the amended complaint survive an Article III standing challenge, Zynga shall be permitted to reassert its challenge to the merits,\" the judge wrote.

The settlement, reached Saturday, awaits final approval later this year from U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, who presides in San Jose, California, where Zoom is based. The lawsuit stems from users' complaints about the company's data privacy and security practices, including instances in which customers had their video conferences interrupted by \"Zoom bombing,\" in which attackers gained access to meeting passwords or bypassed security features and disrupted the proceedings with profanity and offensive images. During the   global pandemic, many organizations have turned to Zoom and other tech firms for video conferencing and collaboration services, which led to an increase in hacking attempts. At one point, the U.S. Justice Department warned that prosecutors could bring federal charges against those who disrupted meetings through Zoom bombing (see:  ). In April 2020, an analysis by  , a group based at the University of Toronto that studies surveillance and its impact on human rights, found that although Zoom advertised that it used full end-to-end encryption, the company only deployed the inadequate AES-128 encryption standard within its cloud-based videoconferencing platform. Since then, Zoom has rolled out enhanced end-to-end encryption using the  . Under the proposed settlement, Zoom would reimburse its customers 15% on their core video conference subscriptions or $25 - whichever is larger - while other plaintiffs could receive up to $15 as part of the reimbursement plan. The settlement covers Zoom customers who subscribed to the Zoom Meetings app between May 30, 2016, and July 30, 2021. It does not apply to enterprise or government accounts. The settlement also calls for Zoom to pay plaintiffs' attorney fees, which total over $21 million. Zoom has also agreed to roll out additional security and privacy protections. \"For example, Zoom agreed to provide in-meeting notifications to make it easier for users to understand who can see, save and share Zoom users' information and content by alerting users when a meeting host or another participant uses a third-party application during a meeting,\" according to the court papers. \"Separately, Zoom will ensure that its privacy statement will disclose the ability of Zoom users to share user data with third parties via integrations third-party software, or otherwise to record meetings, and/or to transcribe meetings.\" Plus, the company - for a year -  will stop its integration with Facebook's software development kit for Apple's iOS for Zoom meetings. The company must also ask Facebook to delete any U.S. user data from the software platform, the court papers note. The settlement will also require that Zoom post information to parents of K-12 children who use the platform as part of their education. The   has previously warned that school meetings and classrooms that use video conferencing tools could be disturbed by hacking and zoom bombing stunts as well. Under the proposed settlement, Zoom will not have to admit any wrongdoing. While an $85 million settlement is not as large as some of the other legal actions tech companies are facing -   announced Friday that it's looking at an $885 million fine under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation - the types of injunctive relief provisions found in these settlements are starting to have an impact when it comes to privacy and security, says Steven Teppler of the law firm Mandelbaum Salsburg P.C. \"These settlements are starting to address, at least on paper, the type of attention that these entities really need to have when it comes to handling personal information,\" Teppler says. \"For many companies, these settlements are saying that they can't look at the general population as their beta testers and rush products out to market and worry about everything else later. And that's been the approach for many of these tech companies.\" Teppler also notes that by agreeing to change the ways it handles customer data and third-party access to that data, Zoom is now in closer compliance with many state privacy and data protection laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act.\r\n \"Zoom would now have to disclose how that information is shared or sold\" under CCPA, says Teppler. Reacting to the settlement, a Zoom spokesperson tells Information Security Media Group: \"We take seriously the trust our users place in us. We are proud of the advancements we have made to our platform, and look forward to continuing to innovate with privacy and security at the forefront.\" Despite concerns about privacy and security, Zoom's business has boomed during the pandemic. In its fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30,   posted revenue of $956 million - up 191% compared to the same period a year earlier, and net income of $227 million, compared to just $27 million a year ago. In May 2020, the New York state attorney general's office announced a settlement with Zoom in which the company agreed to provide better security and privacy controls for its videoconferencing platform (see:  ). Zoom also entered into an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in November 2020 to improve security and data protection practices for its customers (see:  ).

As in other Chinese cyberattacks, these APT campaigns exploited flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers.   The researchers uncovered several previously unidentified cyberattack campaigns infiltrating major providers and evading detection since at least 2017, Cybereason says. Researchers identified three clusters of attacks associated with the campaign that it attributed to the Chinese APTs Soft Cell, Naikon and Threat Group-3390. The firm says overlaps in the attackers' tactics, techniques and procedures suggest a connection between the groups. \"It is not surprising that the telcos targeted in these intrusions are located in ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries, some of which have long-term, publicly known disputes with the People’s Republic of China,\" Cybereason says in its report The security firm says at one time, each cluster was observed in the same environment, operating on the same endpoints at around the same time. \"One thing is certain: All three threat actors are operating on behalf of Chinese state interests,\" says Assaf Dahan, senior director, head of threat research at Cybereason. Telecoms were compromised to facilitate espionage against specific targets - likely corporations, political figures, government officials, law enforcement agencies, political activists and dissidents of interest to the Chinese government, Cybereason says. \"The attackers exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of data collected from the network,\" Dahan says. \"Knowing the threat actors targeted major servers … gives us an indication that PII was also likely compromised.\" The findings follow U.S. President Joe Biden's recent rebuke of Chinese cyber activity, blaming the nation for another series of attacks, detected in January, that exploited vulnerabilities in unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers. The U.S. said last month the criminal group responsible for the attacks - which Microsoft called Hafnium - worked for China's Ministry of State Security, which oversees foreign intelligence operations (see:  ). The new Cybereason report finds that the Chinese APT groups conducted an \"adaptive, persistent and evasive\" campaign to obscure activity and maintain persistence on infected systems. The telecom espionage campaign, like the earlier Hafnium attacks, exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to targeted networks and then proceeded to compromise critical assets - including domain controllers and billing systems with sensitive call detail record data, Cybereason says. \"These attacks compromised telcos primarily in ASEAN countries, but the attacks could be replicated against telcos in other regions,\" the security firm says. \"While the prevailing assessment is that the operations were intended for espionage purposes only, the fact remains that had the attackers decided to change their objectives from espionage to interference, they would have had the ability to disrupt communications for any of the affected telecoms' customers.\" Lior Div, CEO and co-founder of Cybereason, notes: \"The attacks are very concerning because they undermine the security of critical infrastructure providers and expose the confidential and proprietary information of both public and private organizations that depend on secure communications for conducting business.\" State-sponsored espionage operations \"not only negatively impact customers and business partners; they also have the potential to threaten the national security of countries in the region and those who have a vested interest in the region's stability,\" Div adds. Cybereason attributes one cluster of attacks to Soft Cell, an APT group in operation since 2012 that had previously targeted telecom providers in the same region of Southeast Asia. Telemetry and forensic evidence shows that the naming conventions, tools and TTPs in this cluster are similar to those attributed to Soft Cell in  . Researchers say Soft Cell: Cybereason attributes another cluster of activity, first observed in late 2020, to the Naikon APT, based on the unique TTPs involved, including tools and command-and-control server infrastructure. Researchers say this APT: A third cluster involved deployment of a custom Outlook Web Access backdoor used to harvest credentials, Cybereason reports. Activity dates back to 2017; backdoor deployment continued into this year, including a sharp uptick in March, perhaps in response to Microsoft's patches for its Exchange Server vulnerabilities. Code analysis shows similarities with the backdoors \"Dllshellexc2007\" and \"Dllshellexc2010,\" discovered by TrendMicro and attributed to Group-3390, or APT27, aka Emissary Panda. For example: Last month, the U.S. indicted four Chinese nationals connected to the nation's Ministry of State Security over an alleged hacking campaign conducted from 2011 to 2018 that targeted universities and government entities to obtain trade secrets, medical research and other intellectual property (see:  ).

The technique was first spotted in  , according to   research unit. But Microsoft is issuing a fresh warning about the campaigns, contending they're much more dangerous than it first realized. Microsoft calls the campaign \"BazaCall.\" \"In our observation, attacks emanating from the BazaCall threat could move quickly within a network, conduct extensive data exfiltration and credential theft, and distribute ransomware within 48 hours of the initial compromise,\" write   of Microsoft's 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team.  The end result may be an infection with Ryuk or Conti - ransomware believed to be pushed by a Russia-based group known as   and its affiliates. The  , which publishes deep technical dives into attacks, on Sunday published a   of a BazaCall attack that led to Trickbot malware being installed, and, eventually, Conti.  BazaCall campaigns kick off with a targeted spam email as a lure. The email may warn that an expensive subscription, such as one for a photo editing service or a recipe website, may be automatically renewed. More recent BazaCall emails purport to be confirmation receipts for a purchased software license, Carroll and Hacker write.  The emails only appear to be target people on a consumer-type way, but the attackers are interested in enterprise targets.  \"It is likely that the attackers are using consumer-type lures because they're aiming this at a wide variety of people and hoping that many of them use their work emails for personal subscriptions,\" says Hacker, a threat intelligence analyst.  The emails, however, contain no links or malicious attachments, which are triggers that send a message off to quarantine. The emails come from a different sender each time and are sent through free email services. The emails often purport to come from companies that are similar in name to those of real businesses in case people run a quick search.  The messages \"instruct users to call a phone number in case they have questions or concerns,\" Carroll and Hacker write. \"This lack of typical malicious elements - links or attachments - adds a level of difficulty in detecting and hunting for these emails.\"  Hacker tells ISMG the use of a call center may give the operation a greater air of legitimacy as people have become more alert about suspicious links and attachments in emails. Attackers may also achieve a \"higher chance of success versus a traditional link or attachment-based phish, where the attacker is reliant on the user completing all necessary steps on their own.\"\r\n\r\n An audio recording of a call to one of the BazaCall numbers was published on March 30 by  . The call center employee guides the victim to a website where they are directed to enter a subscription number.  Carroll and Hacker write that the subscription number or other numbers serve as identifiers to those executing and tracking the campaign.  The call center employee then guides the victim to a website that looks like a legitimate business. The victim is then instructed to download a file, such as an Excel spreadsheet.  In the audio call, the user is guided to enable macros after a warning is displayed. Eventually, the victim is told that their subscription has been successfully canceled, but instead, the BazaLoader malware has been installed.  The infected computer is then ready for the next stage of the attack.  The macro creates a new folder and copies certutil.exe, a legitimate tool, in that folder. Certutil.exe then connects to BazaLoader's infrastructure. Eventually, the malware retrieves a Cobalt Strike beacon. Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing toolkit, and its   is a tool for delivering payloads, issuing commands and performing tasks on a target's network.  \"Now with direct access, the attacker performs reconnaissance on the network and searches for local administrators and high-privilege domain administrator account information,\" Carroll and Hacker write.  The attackers may then hunt around for Active Directory and then use  , a tool for querying Active Directory. They may also try to pull a copy of the NTDS.dit Active Directory database, which includes user information and password hashes for all users in the domain.  \"Once the attacker has established a list of target devices on the network, they use Cobalt Strike’s custom, built-in   functionality to move laterally to the targets,\" Carroll and Hacker write. \"Each device the attacker lands on establishes a connection to the Cobalt Strike C2 server.\"  In some cases, it appears the attackers are just interested in exfiltrating data. But in others, it's ransomware time. The time span between the initial compromise and when ransomware is deployed may be as little as 48 hours, Carroll and Hacker write.  \"In those cases where ransomware was dropped, the attacker used high-privilege compromised accounts in conjunction with Cobalt Strike’s PsExec functionality to drop a Ryuk or Conti ransomware payload onto network devices,\" Carroll and Hacker write.

Microsoft says it recently patched the flaws.   Palo Alto Networks did not report on whether any exploits using the vulnerabilities were found in the wild,  however Tao Yan, security researcher with the Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 team tells Information Security Group that its researchers reported around 100 Jet vulnerabilities to Microsoft in 2020, though Microsoft only fixed a small number of them. \"It seems that Microsoft's strategy is to mitigate the whole attack surface instead of fixing each individual vulnerability, one by one,\" Yan says.  IIS is a general-purpose web server that runs on Windows, while SQL Server is a relational database management system. Palo Alto Networks described the exploits in a presentation at the recent   event. The exploits take advantage of remote database access supported in Microsoft Jet Database Engine, including Jet Red Database Engine and Access Connectivity Engine, the researchers say. \"When misused, the feature allows attackers to execute SQL queries on the fully controlled database file on the remote attacker’s controlled server,\" the researchers explain. \"Once the remote legitimate database file is replaced with a malformed database file, executing SQL queries on it could break the code precondition and assumptions in Microsoft Jet/ACE, leading to vulnerabilities in many Jet components. \"The typical attack scenarios are SQL injection and ad hoc. In these two scenarios, attackers can execute any SQL queries on the malformed databases in the IIS and SQL server. The resulting Jet vulnerabilities will impact the IIS and SQL server.\" Users can assign a remote database when executing SQL queries on tables by adding a database path ahead of the table in MS Jet and using  ,   or   in ACE. Remote database access allows attackers to replace a legitimate database with a malformed one, the researchers say.  During code development and testing in MS Jet and ACE, developers might not consider the possibility of the database being malformed, so the researchers decided to explore the idea of mutating both SQL queries and database files. It was using that  fuzzing strategy that enabled the researchers to discovered the 100 vulnerabilities in MS Jet and ACE. Most of the vulnerabilities could be used to attack IIS and SQL Server under SQL injection and ad hoc scenarios, the researchers say. Palo Alto Networks says, \"any components supporting MS Jet and ACE on Windows could be vulnerable, as long as the component allows users to execute any query on the controllable database with MS Jet and ACE.\" Microsoft has assigned the flaws the designation   and released a patch. The patch introduces an option to   in the MS Jet component and ACE component. By default, no changes are made to accessing the Jet Red Database Engine or the ACE by installing these updates, a Microsoft spokesperson tells Information Security Media Group. Plus, Microsoft has provided   on blocking access to remote databases. Microsoft recommends customers with any app compatibility issues consider  . Although the patch mitigates the risks, it is not turned on by default - and most Jet vulnerabilities are still not patched, Palo Alto Networks says. \"The mitigation for the attack surface in ACE still remains imperfect, and we are working with Microsoft to release a complete patch for both MS Jet and ACE,\" Yan told ISMG. The Microsoft Jet Database Engine, including MS Jet and ACE, is over 20 years old, and a vast majority of the Jet modules have been found to be easily exploitable due to limited exploit mitigations, the researchers note. \"The remote database access feature connects the Jet vulnerabilities with IIS and SQL server components, thereby downgrading their security to the same level as the Jet Database Engine,\" they add.

After ransomware attacks by Russian-language group Conti against   in May, DarkSide against U.S.-based   the same month, and REvil against remote management software firm   in July, the Biden administration has been moving to much more aggressively disrupt the ransomware business model. The White House has also called out the Russian government for not doing more to police criminals acting from within its borders and threatened to disrupt such operations unless Moscow acts. Feeling the heat, some leading Russian-language cybercrime forums have announced bans or restrictions on ransomware discussions and recruitment, says Bob McArdle, director of cybercrime research at security firm Trend Micro. In addition, some ransomware groups have been exploring whether they might shift to just stealing data and attempting to extort organizations - as, for example, the Clop group did starting in December 2020, when it stole data from   users and held it for ransom, he says. \"We're seeing some groups discussing about just moving to the pure data-leakage model,\" McArdle says. \"Plus, 'We will tell all your customers that we're about to leak your data.' Just those two components. And especially in industries that are tightly regulated, like healthcare or something like that, where if you're breached, that can cost a fortune, then that's a very good target to go after for criminals.\" In this video interview with Information Security Media Group, McArdle also discusses: McArdle is responsible for managing part of Trend Micro's Forward-Looking Threat Research Team, which focuses on cybercrime and criminal underground research, but also researches potential new attack vectors and emerging technologies.

The guidance, released on Tuesday, reviews the security challenges in Kubernetes environments and describes hardening strategies for these infrastructures. These include such measures such as adopting network separation, deploying authentication and implementing misconfiguration management. \"The report details recommendations to harden Kubernetes systems,\" the agencies note. \"Primary actions include the scanning of containers and pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, and using network separation, strong authentication and log auditing. Although this guidance is tailored to national security systems and critical infrastructure organizations, administrators of federal and state, local, tribal and territorial government networks are also encouraged to implement the recommendations provided.\"  Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system used to automate deploying, scaling and managing containerized applications. The agencies note that hackers target Kubernetes for data theft and denial-of-service attacks. They describe risks, including:\r\n The guidance recommends several steps that can be taken to strengthen Kubernetes containers. These include: The NSA and CISA also warn that threat actors have been leveraging the computational power of Kubernetes for cryptomining attacks. In July, security firm Intezer uncovered a hacking campaign that targeted Kubernetes environments using misconfigured Argo Workflows to deploy cryptominers (see:  ). In June, researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 reported on a TeamTNT campaign that targeted Kubernetes clusters and created new malware called Black-T that integrated with open-source cloud-native tools to assist in their cryptojacking operations (see:  ). Another report by Unit 42 described a malware variant that targeted poorly protected or misconfigured Windows containers to access Kubernetes clusters (see:  ).

The 47-page report prepared by the staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which was released Tuesday, states: \"Inspectors general identified many of the same issues that have plagued federal agencies for more than a decade.\" Despite being cited for these same shortcomings in a similar report in 2019, the departments of State, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education - and the Social Security Administration - are still failing to meet even basic cybersecurity standards, the report concludes. Only the Department of Homeland Security was credited with improving its security since the last report was issued. Among the congressional report's findings: The Transportation Department had no record of thousands of IT assets being used by its staff. The State Department had active accounts for workers who had left the agency. And unauthorized shadow IT devices are in use at HUD.  The data for the latest report was compiled using the 2020 annual audit findings from the eight agencies' inspectors general.  The report finds that the seven federal agencies \"still have not met the basic cybersecurity standards necessary to protect America's sensitive data.\" This is particularly troubling, the report states, because nearly 31,000 information security incidents were reported across the federal government in 2020, an 8% increase from 2019.  \"Large-scale cyber incidents like  and  illustrate the considerable threats facing federal agencies,\" the report says. \"These attacks also make the longstanding vulnerabilities repeatedly documented by inspector generals all the more concerning. Unpatched critical vulnerabilities and shadow IT make breaching agencies' networks and stealing sensitive data easier and cheaper, at a time when the federal government should be making it harder and more expensive.\"  Among the report's findings: The report also states that the seven agencies continue to use legacy unsupported computer systems, and six of the agencies failed to install patches.  The report calls for a coordinated approach to cybersecurity across the entire government, including designating a primary office to coordinate with all agencies to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy for the entire federal government.  It recommends that the Office of Management and Budget enforce the adoption of a risk-based strategy when budgeting for IT and security improvements so agencies would only spend money on actual, and not perceived, risks to their systems. The report also recommends that DHS provide to Congress a plan to update the Einstein intrusion detection system and justify its cost.  And it calls for Congress to update the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 to include current security practices, formalize the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's role as the lead federal agency for cybersecurity and require contractors and agencies to notify CISA of certain cyber incidents.  Meanwhile, National Cyber Director  , while speaking at an Atlantic Council virtual event, called attention to a recommendation made by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to establish the Bureau of Cyber Statistics within DHS to collect, analyze and publicly disseminate information on cyber incidents.  Data would be reported to the bureau every 180 days by cybersecurity first responders and cyber insurance carriers, Inglis said. This would help support the development of cybersecurity standards for  , he added.  \"I would observe that to properly address risk, we have to first understand it,\" he said.

And he's learned enough about it to say without reservation: This the largest ransomware attack he's seen. \n                                                             \n                                                                 • \n                                 \n                                 \n                             In its latest quarterly fraud and payments report, Outseer notes a 58% increase in brand abuse – a trend that's only going to grow, says COO Jim Ducharme. He analyzes this and other fraud trends, including how to reduce fraud without compromising user experience. \n                                                             \n                                                                 • \n                                 \n                                 \n                             The CISO/board relationship is an hot topic, and Selim Aissi has a unique perspective. Besides serving as a board member on several organizations, he has been regularly reporting to the private and public company boards in his role as CISO. So he knows exactly what CISOs should be conveying - and how. \n                                                             \n                                                                 • \n                                 \n                                 \n                             During the past year-plus of digital transformation, many enterprises have not just migrated to the cloud but to hybrid cloud environments.

The news comes as   this week made his first extensive remarks on cryptocurrency markets since assuming office in April. Gensler called for additional regulation and more authority from Congress to oversee markets he likened to the \"Wild West.\" At least 102 job listings on PayPal's website connect to its  , which was launched in October 2020 and incrementally expanded over the past 10 months. Some PayPal open positions focus on compliance and anti-money laundering. The new jobs are in the United States, Ireland, Israel, Singapore, Hong Kong and Guatemala. PayPal will rely on crypto engineering, program, strategy, operations and blockchain analytics managers, along with investigators, tax reporting specialists and legal directors, to support its digital money transfer service,  . On a recent   outlining Q2 earnings, PayPal confirmed it will continue expanding its cryptocurrency offerings, launching a \"super app\" wallet and expanding within the U.K. The company launched its first cryptocurrency and blockchain services in late 2020 to enable the   of bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin. This year, PayPal began allowing U.S. customers to use cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services and enabled transfers to third-party wallets. Phishing and business email campaigns designed to steal bitcoins climbed by 192% between October 2020 and April 2021, according to a recent report from  . \"As some companies started to announce that they will accept payments in bitcoin, it generated more interest in cryptocurrency and started to drive its value up,\" Barracuda Networks says. \"Cyberattacks quickly followed, with impersonation attacks growing 192% [between October 2020 and April 2021].\" Barracuda Networks warns that as the price of bitcoin has climbed, cybercriminals have \"started to come up with more sophisticated schemes to cash in on bitcoin-mania.\" Hackers have impersonated digital wallets and other cryptocurrency-related apps with fraudulent security alerts to steal login credentials. In the past, attackers impersonated financial institutions targeting banking credentials, the company notes. \"Today, they are using the same tactics to steal valuable bitcoins,\" it adds. SEC Chairman Gensler weighed in on the volatile cryptocurrency markets on Tuesday, addressing several ongoing concerns raised by both risk management and security experts. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Gensler called the cryptocurrency market \"rife with fraud, scams and abuse.\" \"We haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange,\" Gensler said. \"To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with  .\" The SEC chairman also observed: \"Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. … In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information. If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.\" Gensler called on lawmakers to provide the SEC additional authority to regulate crypto markets: \"We need additional congressional authority to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks. We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.\" The chairman added: \"Right now, large parts of the field of crypto are sitting astride of regulatory frameworks that protect investors and consumers, guard against illicit activity, ensure for financial stability, and yes, protect national security. At the heart of finance is trust. And at the heart of trust in markets is investor protection. If this [cryptocurrency] field is going to continue, or reach any of its potential to be a catalyst for change, we better bring it into public policy frameworks.\" As staff writer on the news desk at Information Security Media Group, Gunderman covers governmental/geopolitical cybersecurity updates from across the globe.

Yet, what have we done to improve our visibility and reduce the critical lag time between incident detection and mitigation? Attacks such as SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline show that adversaries are not only stealthy, persistent and patient … but they also are taking advantage of our complexity – the sheer number of disparate tools, vendors and over-burdened staff that enterprises have cobbled together for defense, leaving dangerous gaps in detection and response. How can one reduce this complexity? What are effective strategies for reducing the number of vendors, simplifying the stack, integrating disparate tools and gaining that single, complete view of threats?

Spanning insider threats and nonstop data breaches, to the latest business-efforts to arrest fraud, malicious insiders and advanced hack attacks, and much more, we have you covered.   As a media sponsor of Infosecurity Europe 2019, ISMG was at the center of the dialogue both at and around the event.  Once again, we returned to the Infosecurity Europe show floor with an open studio amidst the exhibitors and myriad attendees. Sitting down with dozens of the industry’s leading vendors, practitioners and influencers, we gathered expert insight into the cybersecurity topics and strategies that matter most today. All told, we conducted more than 40 exclusive video interviews with a selection of the industry's top thought leaders, including CEOs, CISOs, analysts, researchers and educators.  Conference keynote speaker Troy Hunt, founder of the Have I Been Pwned? service, analyzed for us the nonstop rise of data breaches. Distinguished security researchers – including Raj Samani, Chester Wisniewski and Tod Beardsley – detailed the latest threats and how business must respond. Other leading technology thinkers shared the latest on business adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the quest to block privileged account takeovers and phishing attacks, techniques for securing supply chains, and among many other topics, digital transformation, automation, DevSecOps as well as the growing use of red teams and bug bounties. As the preeminent cybersecurity conference in the region, Infosecurity Europe again cemented its reputation as being the place where those in Europe and the United Kingdom come to talk cybersecurity.\r\nDive into the pages that follow for highlights from the discussion. Information Security Media Group (ISMG) is the world's largest media company devoted to information security and risk management. Each of its 28 media sites provides relevant education, research and news that is specifically tailored to key vertical sectors including banking, healthcare and the public sector; geographies from North America to Southeast Asia; and topics such as data breach prevention, cyber risk assessment and fraud.

This edition of CyberEd APAC features an interview with Brijesh Singh, inspector general of police for cyber in Maharashtra, who outlines the challenges in investigating breaches and the new technologies that are playing an important role, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. He stresses that organizations need to have \"baseline controls\" in place as well as a risk management framework to help prevent breaches. \"You need to have an intelligence framework in association with law enforcement, wherein the dark web is trawled regularly for information which is relevant to you,\" he explains. Also featured in this edition is an interview with Minatee Mishra, a security specialist at Philips, who tackles the topic of managing IoT device risks. She describes \"four guiding principles\" for managing IoT devices. \"One of the ways in which you can minimize the risk is isolate these systems or have a perimeter control which is strong enough to detect any intrusions coming in,\" she says.

What are the most effective strategies that security leaders can use to defend against this threat? Is multifactor authentication (MFA) the answer?  What about new passwordless tech?  Join our conversation as we discuss how organizations can prevent ransomware and credential theft attacks by understanding the tactics threat actors are using along with eliminating the insecure password. 1:00 PM EDT Unlimited Webinars + OnDemand Access 1:00 PM EDT Unlimited Webinars + OnDemand Access Was added to your briefcase Live Webinar | Shut the Front Door!

This change, while beneficial, also meant that millions of healthcare workers and patients began to exchange sensitive healthcare issues over unvetted cloud apps that weren’t built to secure health data. Accelerated adoption of the cloud has driven healthcare organizations to rely more heavily on cloud-based productivity suites and apps that enable both employees and patients to access data from anywhere. Compound this use of managed and unmanaged mobile devices in a world where the network perimeter is being eroded and you have a real challenge at hand. Join the Lookout team today to find out how organizations are adopting a multi-cloud security approach to protect their cloud environment and data from endpoint-to-cloud – regardless of SaaS, IaaS or on-premises application.

In an update, Gartner recently issued a new strategic road map for SASE adoption that emphasizes the need for a detailed migration plan (see:  ). By 2024, Gartner predicts, at least 40% of enterprises worldwide will have explicit strategies for adopting SASE, up from 10% in 2020. Many CISOs tell me the biggest roadblock to implementing SASE is demonstrating the value. And that requires carefully defining the SASE operating model and how it supports, for example, a remote workforce.  “I am excited about the possibilities that SASE brings, as clearly articulated in the report, and I am sure it will be disruptive enough to get enterprises to transition to the digital bandwagon and reap benefits faster,”  , group CISO of Biocon, a large biopharmaceutical company based in Bengaluru, tells me. He says the SASE model will help address data visibility and control issues as enterprises move to the cloud. \"However, CISOs need to bring in changes in operational procedures to take advantage of the centralized control and enforcement mechanisms that come with the implementation of SASE,\" he says.  Nat Smith, senior research director at Gartner, tells me: \"One of the biggest drivers has been the acceleration [to remote work] from the pandemic and boards of directors asking CISOs, 'What are you going to do differently now?'\" Rajpreet Kaur, senior principal analyst at Gartner, says SASE helps in binding the user's identity to the data context, the location, and the types of devices used to access the data to improve authentication.  Many CISOs and security teams now believe that SASE will help them use existing resources efficiently to address the remote access environment and enhance operational efficiency.  , vice president of global security at Concentrix, tells me that the \"work from home\" shift has accelerated the adoption of SASE, which is being used to replace VPNs. SASE is being expanded to include antivirus and patch management at the end-user machines, he says. One of the world's top 10 banks, which used VPN for fast internet access, now uses SASE to go direct-to-net with improved user experience, safely bypassing the VPN, notes Neil Thacker, CISO of Netskope. Gartner published its report introducing the SASE concept,  , in August 2019. \r\n\r\n After the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide shift to a largely remote workforce, interest in SASE grew, prompting Gartner to release its update,  , in April. The latest report says that to adopt SASE, CISOs need a migration strategy that contains the following components:  Gartner's analysts say that \"work from anywhere\" and cloud-based computing have accelerated cloud-delivered SASE offerings to enable anywhere, anytime secure access from any device. Security and risk management leaders should build a migration plan from the legacy perimeter and hardware-based offerings to a SASE model. One hindrance to SASE adoption, some security experts tell me, is that organizations lack visibility into sensitive data and awareness of threats. Too many enterprises have separate security and networking teams that don't share information and lack an all-encompassing security strategy, they say.  \"While the vendors are touting SASE as the end-all solution, the key to success would depend upon how well we define the SASE operating model, particularly when there are so many vendors coming up with SASE-based solutions,\" says Bengaluru-based  , senior vice president and head of the information security services group at Wells Fargo.  , CISO of Indian Oil Corp., says that as data centers move to the cloud, companies need to use SASE to enhance security while controlling costs. Along with Gartner, some practitioners believe that moving to a SASE model could, indeed, help cut operational costs over the long term and close security gaps, making it easier to secure assets in the cloud. And those factors are clearly fueling the movement to SASE.  Nandikotkur is an award-winning journalist with over 20 years of experience in newspapers, audiovisual media, magazines and research.

And yet we've seen a spate of attackers who wield ransomware - including MountLocker, LockBit, REvil and DarkMatter - sharing insights into their inclinations, motivations and tactics.   One perhaps inadvertent takeaway from their interviews is the extent to which ransomware-wielding criminals lie (see:  ).  Researchers at Cisco Talos, for example, interviewed an individual they've called \"Aleks\" who was working as an affiliate with ransomware-as-a-service operations, including LockBit. Such operations develop and offer their crypto-locking malware to affiliates via a portal. The affiliate takes the malware and infects victims. Whenever a victim pays, the operator and affiliate share in the profits. Craig Williams, director of outreach at Cisco Talos, said the biggest surprises from the interactions with Aleks involved how much he appeared to inadvertently reveal. \"The ones that really surprised us the most were the guy's insights into himself that he accidentally shared - namely, the belief that he wanted to convey that he didn't target healthcare and other targets that are ethically charged,\"   told me. \"Now, the reality was, we knew the entire time that he was targeting healthcare. But it was really interesting to see that he wanted to convey this almost Robin Hood-type view of himself - that he was really a good guy that was misunderstood and that had to struggle in life and feed his family.\" If there's a common set of \"interview with a ransomware attacker\" cliches, it's that all attackers claim to love the motherland and their families and that they use cybercrime simply as a way to put food on the table. Faced with such considerations, who among us wouldn't wield ransomware? The White House sees things differently. Although ransomware has been pummeling organizations for years, attacks in May that disrupted critical infrastructure in the U.S. and Ireland led the Biden administration to escalate efforts to eradicate this criminal business model. One such catalyst was the DarkSide RaaS operation hitting Colonial Pipeline Co., leading to a   that if he didn't crack down on criminals operating inside his border, the U.S. reserved the right to do so. In response,   appeared to go quiet.  , aka Sodinokibi, also went quiet after it hit meat-processing giant JBS - which paid it an $11 million ransom - and later remote management software firm Kaseya, leading to about 1,500 organizations getting hit with ransomware. One persistent question has been: Have the  , DarkSide and REvil operations truly gone away, or are they just going to get rebooted with new names? (See:  ) Enter a new operation called  , which claims to have \"incorporated … the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit.\" On Monday, Dmitry Smilyanets of cybersecurity firm Recorded Future's news site The Record published an   with the apparent leader of BlackMatter. Is the operation, however, simply a reboot of DarkSide or another group? \"We are familiar with the DarkSide team from working together in the past, but we are not them, although we are intimate with their ideas,\" the BlackMatter representative told Smilyanets. But security experts, including Fabian Wosar, CTO of security firm Emsisoft, report that there are  , to the extent that they appear to be the same crypto-locking malware and decryption toolsets. After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar)  On Tuesday, blockchain analysis firm   added further evidence of such a relationship, reporting that, based on its analysis of the cryptocurrency wallets being used by BlackMatter, it was simply a rebrand of DarkSide. THREAD: Based on our blockchain analysis, we can confirm reports speculating that DarkSide   group has rebranded to BlackMatter. This is part of a trend in which ransomware groups shut down & reemerge with new names, often after law enforcement actions or media scrutiny— Chainalysis (@chainalysis)  It's useful to highlight exactly how and why attackers might lie, beyond trying to dodge White House reprisals. For example, many operations now claim to have stolen data when they begin extorting victims, to increase the pressure to pay. But not all such claims are true, and when they are, sometimes the stolen data is relatively worthless. Ransomware incident response firm Coveware, for example, reported that near the end of 2020, it was seeing a rise in attackers falsely claiming to have stolen data before they crypto-locked systems. Attackers may make such claims when first attempting to extort a victim, but before they have posted the victim's name to a data leak site or published samples of stolen data. The takeaway for victims who are considering paying a ransom in part because of stolen data is that data theft claims should never be trusted without proof. But many attackers have ways of sidestepping any requests for proof. For example, \"Dissent,\" who runs the DataBreaches.net blog, reported earlier this year that the   operation told her that it never provided copies of stolen data to victims as it \"violates our privacy policy,\" whatever that means. But REvil did say it would share screenshots of directories showing stolen data. Of course, attackers could easily have taken such a screenshot without actually stealing any underlying data. Dissent said the operation also didn't hesitate to lie in the quest to receive a ransom payment. In one excerpt of a chat between a REvil victim and a REvil \"customer support\" worker, for example, the victim asked if data had been stolen. \"We took your data,\" REvil responded. The victim then chose to pay REvil a bitcoin ransom worth $25,000 - negotiated down from $50,000 - with the understanding that the attackers would share a directory listing showing which files had been stolen, Dissent said. After asking for this information again post-payment, REvil's support representative changed their tune, telling the victim: \"We did not take any data from you.\" Clearly, ransomware attackers routinely   or use fuzzy math. Many groups now practice so-called  , which involves demanding one ransom for a decryptor and another for the promise that stolen data will be deleted - if indeed any data was even stolen in the first place. Last year, Coveware warned that \"unlike negotiating for a decryption key, negotiating for the suppression of stolen data has no finite end,\" and it was likely attackers would never delete such data. In the case of REvil, it noted some victims who paid were extorted a second time - with a repeat threat to leak stolen data unless they paid more. Attackers, however, keep looking to gain any potential edge for reaching a payday. Some have taken to using so-called triple extortion -  adding distributed denial-of-service attacks to further disrupt a victim - or even  , in which they contact a breached organization's customers or business partners to tell them about the attack. Perhaps it should go without saying that ransomware attackers spin their version of reality to make themselves look as good as possible. In the fallout from the Colonial Pipeline hit, for example, DarkSide's administrators blamed an affiliate for poor target selection. But this is disingenuous in the extreme. \"If you think about it, in the affiliate model of ransomware, the affiliates are like contractors that you're responsible for,\"  , director of cybercrime research at Trend Micro, tells me. \"They're not quite like your core group. But they're still people that you're responsible for, and if they go off and do things that are outside your rules, just like in the real world, there's a certain amount of repercussions on you as the company that hired them, for want of a better word.\" BlackMatter, meanwhile, claims that it will vet all targets before affiliates are allowed to unleash crypto-locking malware. BlackMatter's supposed list of rules on its site states that \"we do not attack\" a long list of entity types, including hospitals, critical infrastructure, oil and gas firms, defense contractors, nonprofit organizations or government agencies. But don't forget to read the small print: \"If your company is on that list you can ask us for free decryption.\" So while the operation claims that it will practice exceptional care when picking targets, in fact, what it appears to be saying is that lots of organizations are going to get hit, and if yours falls into one of the aforementioned categories, it will consider sharing a \"free\" decryption tool. Of course, that's a different scenario, because recovering from a ransomware hit can take months, if not years. Ireland, for example, literally deployed the army to help roll out new systems for its health service after it was hit by Conti ransomware. Sure, Conti gave it a \"free decryptor.\" But the attack led to weeks, if not months, of unnecessary disruption, putting lives in danger. The obviously better approach, of course, would be to not hit organizations with ransomware in the first place. But for so many criminals, whatever their claims or supposed rules, this remains a step too far - even if they might claim otherwise.

The new BlackMatter ransomware-as-a-service operation announced its launch last month via Russian-language cybercrime forums. \"The project has incorporated in itself the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit,\" a user with the handle \"BlackMatter\" claimed in July 19 posts, threat intelligence firm   reported (see:  ). Although ransomware operators love bluster, the BlackMatter operation, indeed, looks to have been spawned from at least one prior ransomware effort.   reports that it was able to obtain a decryptor from a BlackMatter victim and share it with ransomware-hunting expert Fabian Wosar, CTO of security firm Emsisoft, for review. Wosar told the publication that numerous shared characteristics between the BlackMatter and DarkSide code means it's extremely likely they're the same. \"After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here,\" Wosar tweeted on Saturday. \"Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.\" A copy of BlackMatter ransomware has also been uploaded by McAfee scientist Christiaan Beek to cybercrime tracking site Abuse.ch's  , leading to other security firms also verifying that it's a rebranding of DarkSide. After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar)  \"We have seen some indication that currently suggests that at least one actor connected to some DarkSide ransomware operations is aligning themselves with BlackMatter,\" Kimberly Goody, director of financial crime analysis at Mandiant, tells Bleeping Computer. As that careful phrasing suggests, seeing someone attack organizations with reskinned DarkSide - now called BlackMatter - doesn't mean that the DarkSide operation, per se, has resurfaced. Instead, one or more individuals possess the code - and, seemingly, the ability to generate both encryptors and decryptors. DarkSide was run as a ransomware-as-a-service operation, which refers to a business model in which operators supply crypto-locking malware to affiliates. The affiliates then use the malware to infect networks and share in any ransom paid by a victim. Experts say it's common for affiliates to keep 70% of ransoms, with 30% going to operators. But it's not clear if whoever now has the DarkSide code helped found or run that operation, or if they were an affiliate or obtained the code via other means. What is clear: Ransomware operations were making money hand over fist, seemingly with nothing to stop them, until the DarkSide operation hit Colonial Pipeline Co. on May 7, disrupting fuel deliveries to much of the U.S. East Coast. Security experts have told me that the DarkSide affiliate that hit Colonial Pipeline probably didn't even really understand what the organization did. Regardless, news of the attack provided a clear reminder to the world: Mess with Americans' gas tanks at your peril. The Biden administration has moved to more aggressively counter the ransomware business model, including by threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin that if he doesn't crack down on criminals operating from inside his country's borders, then the U.S. reserves the right to do so. With the caveat that criminals lie, DarkSide blamed the Colonial Pipeline hit on an affiliate. This was disingenuous because DarkSide was a ransomware-as-a-service operation, meaning most - if not all - infections using DarkSide's malware would have been done by affiliates. \"In the affiliate model of ransomware, the affiliates are like contractors that you're responsible for,\" says Bob McArdle, director of cybercrime research at Trend Micro. \"They're not quite like your core group. But they're still people that you're responsible for. And if they go off and do things that are outside your rules, just like in the real world, there's a certain amount of repercussions on you as the company that hired them, for want of a better word.\" After Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million ransom to DarkSide, the operation reported on May 13 that its infrastructure was being disrupted, and it said it would  . Unusually, the FBI also managed to  . \"In view of the above and due to the pressure from the U.S., the affiliate program is closed. Stay safe and good luck,\" DarkSide reportedly said on its data leak site. \"The landing page, servers and other resources will be taken down within 48 hours.\" The return of DarkSide's code being used in attacks comes as no surprise. Security experts to whom I've spoken in recent weeks said they expected any operations that supposedly announced their retirement to quickly return to the fray with a new name and fresh branding. Likewise, affiliates typically work with multiple ransomware operations - often at the same time - meaning that if one closes up shop, many more remain. Last week, for example, Wosar reported that at least one organization had suffered a fresh attack via the REvil - aka Sodinokibi - ransomware. The group behind that operation went quiet last month, following the July 2 attack it unleashed via  , infecting about 60 of its managed service provider customers and up to 1,500 of their clients' systems. Kudos for Kaseya, however, in that it has   - the company says it paid no ransom - and has been helping victims decrypt their files. Whether REvil has made a comeback or someone else has obtained its code is not yet clear. Yet another example concerns the DoppelPaymer - aka DopplePaymer - operation, which in May stopped posting new victims to its website. But now, the group is back in a new form, rebranded as Grief - for \"pay or grief\" (see:  ). The impetus for the name change is apparently the operator attempting to trick victims into paying it a ransom, despite the operation having been   maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control in 2019, says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft. \"DoppelPaymer is a product of Evil Corp, and Evil likely launched and transitioned to the Grief brand either so organizations would not realize they are breaking OFAC sanctions when paying or, perhaps, to provide them with plausible deniability,\" he tells me. So while ransomware operations may sometimes claim to retire or pause their attacks, security experts tracking their crypto-locking code in the wild often tell a different story.

This change has driven many to adopt a   framework, which is based on the concept that no device or user can be trusted to access resources until that device or user has been validated to be secure.  As it stands now, however, attackers are taking advantage of a visibility gap to execute more advanced cyberattacks. Organizations need to take Zero Trust to the next level by implementing an advanced cloud access security broker, or  , solution that solves many of the challenges presented by the hybrid work environment.  In order to understand how this is done, it’s important to first understand the challenges that all organizations, regardless of size or industry, are now facing. In order to make sure data isn’t being mishandled, knowingly or unknowingly, every organization should implement data loss prevention, or  , policies. This will enable them to automatically classify, protect and encrypt sensitive data and help ensure its integrity.  Employees now expect to be able to access company data from any device. To keep up with this expectation, most organizations allowed access to the infrastructure from personal and unmanaged devices. This introduced a high volume of risk as these devices haven’t been protected by a security solution and could introduce malware into the infrastructure. The right CASB solution will enable your organization to dial in dynamic access policies. Contextual signals such as location, device type and user behavior will ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data. This is a key part of stopping attacks before they happen. Especially on personal mobile devices, attackers have a myriad of ways to deliver phishing attacks and malicious content. Socially engineered campaigns that target individuals across social, gaming and even dating platforms entice employees to share login credentials or download malicious applications that give attackers a backstage pass to your infrastructure.  Without visibility into the context under which devices and users access corporate data, many organizations are missing telltale signs of a compromised account, such as anomalous login location or massive file exfiltration. User and entity behavior analytics, or  , is an important part of CASB that will help organizations identify and protect against anomalous behavior that’s indicative of a  .  To get the most out of their cloud apps and infrastructure without putting data at risk, organizations need to know everything that’s going on and how it’s happening. They also need to be able to detect and respond to threats. Implementing a CASB solution will provide full visibility into the interactions between users, endpoints, cloud apps and data. It also will enable an organization to dynamically dial in Zero Trust access controls. The challenges that come with enabling employees for remote work are here to stay, and attackers will only continue to evolve their tactics in response to that. Keeping a step ahead of them by leveraging an advanced CASB solution is one of the most straightforward ways to keep your organization safe and out of the headlines. Learn more about Lookout CASB  .

That started his crusade to figure out how to teach machines to find and fix those flaws, which led to him creating Mayhem. Mayhem is a machine that applies patching and continuous penetration testing autonomously and in real time. “Mayhem has helped [companies] do two things: Every time we say there’s a bug, we prove it, and the second is we help them better test their software to make sure good stuff works … as well as that no bad things can occur. And Mayhem automates both,” he says. In this episode of \"Cybersecurity Unplugged,\" Brumley discusses: David Brumley is the CEO of ForAllSecure, a cybersecurity company whose products are based on the Mayhem machine. He is also a researcher in software security, network security and applied cryptography.

In May, XSS and Exploit each banned any discussion related to ransomware and ransomware as a service. And the moderators deleted older conversations on the topic in an effort to avoid any confrontation with law enforcement agencies, Digital Shadows says. The operators hoped the ban would alleviate a focus on the forums by the federal government and law enforcement agencies as a result of the disruptive ransomware attack by DarkSide on   in June and  's attack on the remote management software company Kaseya.  DarkSide and REvil had representatives operating on each forum, the report notes. 's attack on Colonial Pipeline temporarily disrupted fuel deliveries to much of the East Coast, while REvil's attack affected 60 of  's managed service provider customers and up to 1,500 of their clients.   Once the two forums' ransomware chatter ban was in place, accounts belonging to REvil and DarkSide were banned by XSS and Exploit. Soon after, accounts by the gang Avaddon also were banned, the report says. Many of XSS and Exploit's forum members applauded the ban on ransomware, calling the activity immoral, Digital Shadows says. But others took an opposing view.  \"Many forum users had called for ransomware to be banned even before this ruling, particularly after a woman died in Germany after the hospital treating her fell victim to a ransomware attack in September 2020,\" Digital Shadows says. \"However, many other users reacted negatively, dismissing 'the morality police' and predicting that the forums would suffer without the revenue generated through the ransomware trade.\"  Digital Shadows points out that many darknet forum members are not inclined to follow any rules, much less those imposed by a forum. This has proven true for XSS and Exploit, because the ban has led threat actors to try different methods of communication as a workaround, the threat intelligence firm reports. \"It seems that as long as ransomware representatives refrain from using the word 'ransomware' in their posts, they are allowed to stand,\" Digital Shadows notes.  The forums' moderators, however, are attempting to control what is said and have blocked certain users who have broken the rules, such as by discussing or advertising ransomware-as-a-service offerings, according to the threat intelligence firm's report.  \"While the trade in ransomware-related services has largely disappeared from the cybercriminal forums that implemented the ban, we have still seen threads discussing ransomware-related issues, such as what to do with system accesses previously destined for ransomware affiliates, speculation about potential law enforcement involvement in ransomware campaigns, cooperation between national law enforcement agencies in counter-ransomware operations and predictions about the future of ransomware,\" the report notes.  In some cases, the forum operators are allowing smaller violations to continue, Digital Shadows says.  \"This strict approach isn't universal, though, and not all new ransomware-related posts are being flagged,\" the report states. \"For example, one forum member shared a link to the Himalaya RaaS recruitment page with no negative consequences. We have also seen users sharing Petya ransomware source code and advertising a Chaos ransomware builder, a Thanos ransomware builder and decryptor, and a GitHub submission for Ryuk ransomware.\" This could indicate that other forum members don't bother reporting possible violations or the moderators don't have the time and bandwidth to respond to all offending content.  Digital Shadows also says that, eventually, the forum operators will simply ignore their own regulations and allow ransomware conversations to resume. This is the case with numerous other \"rules\" on cybercriminal platforms, the analysts say.\r\n Meanwhile, Digital Shadows says that many ransomware attackers have shifted away from these two forums to use other sites.  \"Ransomware groups may also be using other platforms to recruit, e.g., private messaging applications,\" the team says, pointing to the darknet forum   as one such newly created criminal resource.

One calls for imposing sanctions against countries that allow   to operate within their borders. Another would require law enforcement agencies to better track cybercrime statistics to identify trends.   On Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the senior member of the committee, introduced the  .  In addition to calling for sanctions against governments that allow cybercriminals to operate, the bill would establish cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure and create new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. \"The most important part of this bill is the sections highlighting the fact that ransomware groups are operating with impunity in locations owned by governments that are providing a safe harbor from international law enforcement and the direction to develop regulatory actions around cryptocurrency,\" says Austin Berglas, who formerly was an assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations at the FBI's New York office. Berglas, now the global head of professional services at cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant, also notes that the part of the bill that calls for cryptocurrency exchanges to better monitor suspicious transactions and adhere to know-your-customer standards would help the FBI and other law enforcement agencies track virtual currency used in ransomware extortion attempts. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and the Senate has introduced legislation called the  , which would require the Justice Department and the FBI to compile more detailed statistics about cybercrime as well as develop a taxonomy to help contextualize and sort this data. \"What we do not measure, we cannot fix. By improving reporting on cybercrime, this bill is the first step toward fighting back against a massive scourge afflicting consumers, communities and our economy,\" says Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., one of several senators co-sponsoring the bill. Congress is already considering several other proposals to help counter cyberthreats that have been introduced in the aftermath of the supply chain attack against  , intrusions against vulnerable   servers conducted by groups connected to China and ransomware attacks that targeted critical infrastructure, such as the attack on  For example, a federal breach notification bill sponsored by Rubio and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., would require certain organizations to report cyberattacks within 24 hours or a face a penalty (see:  ). Meanwhile, the Biden administration issued sanctions against Russia for its alleged role in the SolarWinds attacks. And this week, Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, left open the possibility of levying sanctions against China over the Exchange attacks (see:  ). Speaking at the Black Hat 2021 conference on Thursday, Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, noted that actions by Russia and China threaten the stability of the global internet. \"We are competing between two visions - one from countries like Russia, China and Iran who want to limit access and maximize control, and another from the United States and our allies who want to build and protect a free, open and secure internet,\" Mayorkas said. The bill that Rubio and Feinstein introduced this week would allow the secretary of state, in consultation with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to designate a foreign government as a \"state sponsor of ransomware\" when a country allows a cybercriminal gang to operate freely within its borders. The measure would require the president to issue sanctions against these countries. \"Our bipartisan bill provides the tools necessary to help safeguard critical infrastructure while discouraging and disrupting these criminal organizations, including the regimes who harbor them,\" Rubio says. The bill also would require the operators of cryptocurrency exchanges to report suspicious activity, such as virtual currency used as part of a ransomware extortion scheme, to regulators. And it would create cybersecurity standards for agencies and businesses that oversee critical infrastructure. Mike Hamilton, a former vice chair of the Department of Homeland Security's State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government Coordinating Council, says some of the bill's provisions may be redundant. \"The State Department already has a reward available for information that will tie a ransomware gang to a supportive government,\" says Hamilton, now the CISO for Critical Insight. \"We already have the capability to sanction bad actors, and legislation has been previously introduced to mandate reporting of ransomware events.\" The second bill under consideration would require the FBI to integrate cybercrime statistics into the bureau's various reporting mechanisms. It would also require state and local law enforcement officials, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies, to report cybercrime numbers from their jurisdictions to the FBI. The bill also would require the Justice Department to work with the National Academy of Sciences to create a taxonomy to help researchers better study statistics related to cybercrime. Plus, the measure would require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report on the effectiveness and shortcomings of reporting cybercrime statistics. While the   requires federal agencies to report property crime to the FBI, reporting of cybercrime to the bureau from federal and local law enforcement agencies is inconsistent, says  , who is one of the co-sponsors of the House version of the bill. The measures would make those reporting standards more uniform and centralized, she says.

Symantec reports that the campaign was active from November 2020 to March this year and targeted a water company, a power company, a communications company and a defense organization. The attackers used different techniques such as deploying malicious apps, search order hijacking and exploiting vulnerabilities in a Google Chrome Frame plug-in designed for Internet Explorer. Once successful compromising the systems, the attackers proceeded to credential theft and then collected information about the victim's SCADA systems. SCADA comprises software and hardware that allows industrial organizations to control industrial processes locally or remotely, as well as monitor and gather real-time data. Symantec reports that \"There are some indications that the attacker behind this campaign is based in China,\" based on \"certain artifacts found on the victim machines,\" but it did not provide further details and went on to say that, \"with the current information available, Symantec cannot attribute the activity to a known actor.\"  The report adds,  \"We did not observe the attackers exfiltrating data from the infected machines. However, the machine the attackers were on did have tools on it that indicate it may have been involved in the design of SCADA systems, indicating this is something the attacker may have been interested in.\" To target the unidentified water company, the attackers used a legitimate free multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini to load a malicious DLL. The malware then loaded several ProcDump hacking tools for credential theft.\r\n In the case of the power company, the attackers deployed the same PotPlayer malware and ProcDump. However, in addition to this strain, the attackers also leveraged another unidentified payload, the report notes. When targeting a victim in the communication sector, the attackers leveraged Google Chrome Frame to deploy malware and collect the victim's data. \"In the defense organization we once again saw PotPlayer Mini exploited for DLL search order hijacking, as well as seeing some file overlaps between this organization and the communications and water companies,\" the report says. Chinese espionage activities have targeted several victims in recent months. These include attacks against corporations, political figures, government officials, law enforcement agencies, political activists and dissidents of interest to the Chinese government. For instance, on Tuesday, security firm Cybereason uncovered a Chinese advanced persistent threat group that compromised telecommunication network providers across Southeast Asia in an effort to harvest customers' sensitive communications (see:  ). In a U.S. Senate hearing this week, senators and those testifying said that China is stealing IP through espionage campaigns to support its efforts to dominate technology development, such as for artificial intelligence and semiconductors. It was suggested that China could leverage this technology worldwide for espionage (see:  ). Last month, the U.S. indicted four Chinese nationals connected to the nation's Ministry of State Security for an alleged hacking campaign conducted from 2011 to 2018 that targeted universities and government entities to obtain trade secrets, medical research and other intellectual property (see:  ).

The FDIC, which deploys nearly 4,600 smartphones and more than 150 tablets to its employees and contractor personnel, was only partially effective in awareness training, billing analysis and configuration management, according to the audit, which covered the period from July 2019 to April 2021. But the reports says it implemented effective controls in the areas of asset management, incident response and data protection. OIG auditors made nine recommendations to the FDIC. For example, it recommended the agency: The FDIC concurred with all nine OIG recommendations and plans to complete corrective actions by May 30, 2022. The FDIC's mobile security policies, procedures and guidance, the report finds, did not reflect current business practices, nor did they mirror important NIST guidance. The agency did not properly implement a BYOD program or adequately address the risks associated with personal use of FDIC-furnished devices, the report notes.  In May 2019, the FDIC began allowing its bank examiners the option of using personal smartphones for work, the report notes. The FDIC developed a set of \"frequently asked questions\" about BYOD security requirements, but it failed to adopt a written policy, it adds. In addition, the agency has not defined \"acceptable use\" of mobile applications, and many employees have downloaded non-work-related apps, the OIG audit determined. That creates a security risk because some apps can track, access and share a user's activity for third-party use. The report also states that the FDIC's logging and monitoring practices were not guided by written procedures and did not provide for adequate separation of duties. \"The absence of written procedures for reviewing audit logs increased the operational risk associated with staff turnover because [the agency's Division of Information Technology] was dependent on the knowledge and experience of a key administrator to perform this function,\" the report states. The OIG report says the agency did not test software updates for its mobile devices before users downloaded and installed them. \"The approach presents an operational risk that users will install a software update that causes a widespread IT interoperability issue,\" auditors say. For example, the report says that after an OS software update was installed in certain smartphones in 2019, some users were not able to sync their device's mobile hot spot capabilities to the agency's network on their work laptops. That's because the software was not fully compatible with the software on the FDIC's laptops. \"Had [the agency] completed its functional testing before allowing users to download the software update, [it] could have identified and remediated the hot spot connectivity issue before users started calling the help desk,\" the OIG states. Auditors recommended the FDIC configure its MDM solution to prevent users from downloading and installing updates until they are properly tested. Although the agency has since implemented a three-day download/install delay to allow time for testing, auditors say the change has not been reflected in the FDIC's policies. Although the FDIC requires employees to complete annual information security and privacy training, auditors found the program contained limited information on mobile device threats, including the use of unsecured public Wi-Fi, and how to identify suspicious activity. The auditors recommend adherence to NIST's Mobile Threat Catalog. The OIG report says the FDIC also did not routinely report usage information for its mobile devices and mobile Wi-Fi hot spot routers to business units - including information on zero usage - potentially presenting a wider attack surface. The FDIC's CIO and CPO, Sylvia Burns, wrote to the OIG, concurring with the findings. \"The issues identified in the report represent opportunities for the FDIC to improve the mobile device management program and better ensure policies and procedures are applied consistent with OMB policy, NIST guidance, and internal security policies,\" Burns wrote. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment further on the OIG's findings.

Experts note this isn't the first time REvil has hit MSPs, or even Kaseya. \n                                                                         \n                                                                         • \n                                         \n                     \n                 U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered federal intelligence agencies to investigate the incident involving IT management software vendor Kaseya. Attackers reportedly compromised Kaseya's remote monitoring system, VSA, potentially affecting scores of managed service providers and their clients. \n                                                                         \n                                                                         • \n                                         \n                     \n                 Since Friday afternoon, Mark Loman of Sophos has been immersed in studying the scope and impact of the ransomware attack spread through Kaseya VSA's remote management platform. And he's learned enough about it to say without reservation: This the largest ransomware attack he's seen. \n                                                                         \n                                                                         • \n                                         \n                     \n                 Mercedes-Benz USA says one of its vendors exposed 1.6 million records that pertained to its customers and interested buyers.

That means they should avoid relying on just one CDN provider, security experts say. \n                                                                         \n                                                            ,\n                                                                                 \n                                                            ,\n                                                                                 \n                                                                         • \n                                         \n                     \n                 Remote management software vendor Kaseya has obtained a decryption tool for all organizations affected by the massive ransomware attack launched via its software.

Last week, both   and security researcher   shared that a new threat actor named 'BlackMatter' had posted to hacking forums where they want to purchase access to corporate networks. In the post, the threat actor stated that they want to buy access to networks in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Great Britain, except for networks associated with medical and government entities. They further shared that they were willing to spend $3,000 to $100,000 per network that had the following criteria: To show that they were serious, the threat actor deposited four bitcoins ($120,000) in the Exile hacking forum's cryptocurrency wallet to show that they mean business and were a serious player. As forums promoting ransomware are now banned on the XSS and Exploit forums, the threat actor did not indicate how they would use the network access. That same day, researchers from Recorded Future revealed that a new Tor data leak site for a 'BlackMatter' ransomware operation appeared on the dark web last week. The name indicates that the BlackMatter threat actor is the public-facing representative for the ransomware operation under the same name. In addition to posting information about themselves their operation, BlackMatter states that they will not target entities in the following industries: Recorded Future says the gang's ransomware executables come in various formats so that they can encrypt different operating systems and device architecture. \"The ransomware is provided for several different operating systems versions and architectures and is deliverable in a variety of formats, including a Windows variant with SafeMode support (EXE / Reflective DLL / PowerShell) and a Linux variant with NAS support: Synology, OpenMediaVault, FreeNAS (TrueNAS),\"   Recorded Future. \"According to BlackMatter, the Windows ransomware variant was successfully tested on Windows Server 2003+ x86/x64 and Windows 7+ x64 / x86. The Linux ransomware variant was successfully tested on ESXI 5+, Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOs. Supported file systems for Linux include VMFS, VFFS, NFS, VSAN.\" At this time, there are no victims listed on the site. However, the ransomware gang states that \"all blogs hidden for now. For a very short time,\" indicating that they are actively attacking victims. BleepingComputer has been able to confirm that there are active attacks underway and that at least one victim paid $4 million to the threat actors this week. Based on the negotiation chat, this is a veteran ransomware operation and most likely a rebrand of one of the larger and now-defunct groups that recently shut down. Information discovered by security researchers as well as the similarities in web sites and partners may indicate that BlackMatter has recruited or was created by threat actors that were previously with the DarkSide and the REvil ransomware operations. As ransomware gangs commonly rebrand to evade law enforcement, when we   in August 2020, some security researchers and law enforcement believed REvil was rebranding as the new DarkSide operation. However, both gangs continued operating side-by-side for almost a year until  . Feeling the full pressure of the US government and law enforcement, DarkSide   in May. The shut down of DarkSide was first reported by REvil's public-facing representative, Unknown, who posted about it on a hacking forum. Two months later, it was   after conducting a   worldwide through a zero-day Kaseya VSA vulnerability. Like DarkSide, REvil was feeling   and international law enforcement. It is widely speculated that the Russian government told them to shut down and disappear for a while. After seeing the BlackMatter Tor site, security researchers found that it showed a strong resemblance to the now-defunct DarkSide ransomware's Tor site. Both pages share a similar color theme, similar language, a similar way of referring to themselves, and also included a list of targets they would not attack. Recorded Future also reported that BlackMatter said, \"The project has incorporated in itself the best features of DarkSide, REvil, and LockBit.\" Finally, cybersecurity firm Mandiant has seen indicators suggesting that an actor previously connected to DarkSide is now partnering with BlackMatter. \"We have seen some indication that currently suggests that at least one actor connected to some DARKSIDE ransomware operations is aligning themselves with BLACKMATTER,\" Kimberly Goody, Mandiant Director of Financial Crime Analysis, told BleepingComputer. \"This isn’t necessarily surprising as we commonly see ransomware affiliates partnering with multiple providers.\" While many clues indicate that this may be a rebrand of DarkSide, or possibly created by actors from both groups, we will not know for sure until a sample of the ransomware is analyzed for code similarities.

In June, a security researcher accidentally revealed a zero-day Windows print spooler vulnerability known as   (CVE-2021-34527) that allowed remote code execution and elevation of privileges. While Microsoft   to fix the vulnerability, researchers quickly figured out ways to   under certain conditions. Since then, researchers have continued to devise new ways to exploit the vulnerability, with one researcher creating an Internet-accessible print server allowing anyone to open a command prompt with administrative privileges. Security researcher and Mimikatz creator   has been at the forefront of continuing PrintNightmare research, releasing multiple bypasses and updates to exploits through   and by abusing Windows APIs. To illustrate his research, Delpy created an Internet-accessible print server at \\\\printnightmare[.]gentilkiwi[.]com that installs a print driver and launches a DLL with SYSTEM privileges. Initially, the launched DLL would write a log file to the C:\\Windows\\System32 folder, which should only be writable by users with elevated privileges. Want to test   (ep 4.x) user-to-system as a service? \n(POC only, will write a log file to system32) \nconnect to \\\\  with \n- user: .\\gentilguest \n- password: password \nOpen 'Kiwi Legit Printer - x64', then 'Kiwi Legit Printer - x64 (another one)'  As some people did not believe his initial print driver could elevate privileges, on Tuesday, Delpy modified the driver to launch a SYSTEM command prompt instead. This new method effectively allows anyone, including threat actors, to get administrative privileges simply by installing the remote print driver. Once they gain administrative rights on the machine, they can run any command, add users, or install any software, effectively giving them complete control over the system. This technique is especially useful for threat actors who breach networks for the deployment of ransomware as it allows quick and easy access to administrative privileges on a device that helps them spread laterally through a network. BleepingComputer installed Delpy's print driver on a fully patched Windows 10 21H1 PC as a user with 'Standard' (limited) privileges to test this technique. As you can see, once we installed the printer and disabled Windows Defender, which detects the malicious printer, a command prompt was opened that gave us full SYSTEM privileges on the computer. When we asked Delpy if he was concerned that threat actors were abusing his print server, he told us that one of the driving reasons he created it is to pressure \"Microsoft to make some priorities\" into fixing the bug. He also said that it's impossible to determine what IP addresses belong to researchers or threat actors. However, he has firewalled Russian IP addresses that appeared to be abusing the print servers. Delpy has warned that this is not the end of Windows print spooler abuse, especially with new research being revealed this week at both the   and   security conferences. As anyone can abuse this remote print server on the Internet to get SYSTEM level privileges on a Windows device, Delpy has offered several ways to mitigate the vulnerability. These methods are outlined in a   written by  , a vulnerability analyst for CERT/CC. The most extreme way to prevent all PrintNightmare vulnerabilities is to disable the Windows Print spooler using the following commands. However, using this mitigation will prevent the computer from being able to print. As Delpy's public exploit uses a remote print server, you should block all RPC Endpoint Mapper ( ) and SMB (  and  ) traffic at your network boundary. However, Dormann warns that blocking these protocols may cause existing functionality to no longer work as expected. \"Note that blocking these ports on a Windows system may prevent expected capabilities from functioning properly, especially on a system that functions as a server,\" explained Dormann. The best way to prevent a remote server from exploiting this vulnerability is to restrict Point and Print functionality to a list of approved servers using the 'Package Point and print - Approved servers' group policy. This policy prevents non-administrative users from installing print drivers using Point and Print unless the print server is on the approved list.  To enable this policy, launch the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) and navigate to  >   >   >   >  . Then enable the policy and enter the list of servers that you wish to allow to use as a print server and then press  to enable the policy. If you do not have a print server on your network, you can enter a fake server name to enable the feature. Using this group policy will provide the best protection against the known exploit but will not prevent a threat actor from taking over an allowed print server with malicious drivers. <p>Come on &quot;to pressure &quot;Microsoft to make some priorities&quot;&quot; MS already knows.

After conducting an  , the US's largest fuel pipeline, and causing fuel shortages in the southeast of the USA, the DarkSide ransomware group faced   by international law enforcement and the US government. In May, the   after losing access to their servers and cryptocurrency was seized by an unknown third-party.  It was later learned that the   of the approximately 75 Bitcoin ($4 million) ransom payment made by Colonial Pipeline. This week, a   that is actively attacking victims and purchasing network access from other threat actors to launch new attacks. BleepingComputer is aware of multiple victims targeted by BlackMatter with ransom demands ranging from $3 to $4 million. One victim has already paid a $4 million ransom to BlackMatter this week to delete stolen data and receive both a Windows and Linux ESXi decryptor. While researching the new ransomware group, BleepingComputer found a decryptor from a BlackMatter victim and shared it with Emisosft CTO and ransomware expert  . After analyzing the decryptor, Wosar confirmed that the new BlackMatter group is using the same unique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks. After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix. Wosar told BleepingComputer that the encryption routines used by BlackMatter are pretty much the same, including a custom Salsa20 matrix unique to DarkSide.

When encrypting files, Fabian told BleepingComputer that instead of using constant strings, a position, nonce, and key, for each encrypted file, DarkSide fills the words with random data. This matrix is then encrypted with a public RSA key and stored in the footer of the encrypted file. Fabian says this Salsa20 implementation was previously only used by DarkSide, and now BlackMatter. BleepingComputer was also told that DarkSide used an RSA-1024 implementation unique to their encryptor, which BlackMatter also uses. While there is not 100% proof that BlackMatter is a rebrand of the DarkSide operation, many similar characteristics make it hard to believe this is not the case. When we take the same encryption algorithms, the similar language used on the BlackMatter sites, similar craving of media attention, and similar color themes for their TOR sites, it is highly like that BlackMatter is the new DarkSide. A rebrand from DarkSide also explains the reason the new BlackMatter group won't target the \"Oil and Gas industry (pipelines, oil refineries),\" which led to their previous downfall. Unfortunately, this is a highly skilled group that targets multiple device architectures, including Windows, Linux, and ESXi servers. Due to this, we will need to keep an eye on this new group as they will surely perform attacks on well-known targets in the future. The language barrier is a funny thing.

After conducting an  , the US's largest fuel pipeline, and causing fuel shortages in the southeast of the USA, the DarkSide ransomware group faced   by international law enforcement and the US government. In May, the   after losing access to their servers and cryptocurrency was seized by an unknown third-party.  It was later learned that the   of the approximately 75 Bitcoin ($4 million) ransom payment made by Colonial Pipeline. This week, a   that is actively attacking victims and purchasing network access from other threat actors to launch new attacks. BleepingComputer is aware of multiple victims targeted by BlackMatter with ransom demands ranging from $3 to $4 million. One victim has already paid a $4 million ransom to BlackMatter this week to delete stolen data and receive both a Windows and Linux ESXi decryptor. While researching the new ransomware group, BleepingComputer found a decryptor from a BlackMatter victim and shared it with Emisosft CTO and ransomware expert  . After analyzing the decryptor, Wosar confirmed that the new BlackMatter group is using the same unique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks. Wosar told BleepingComputer that the encryption routines used by BlackMatter are pretty much the same, including a custom Salsa20 matrix unique to DarkSide.

Early Sunday morning, the Lazio region suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted every file in its data center and disrupted its IT network. \"On the night between Saturday and Sunday the Regione Lazio suffered a first cyber attack of criminal matrix. We don't know who is responsible and their goals,\" Nicola Zingaretti, the President of the Lazio region, said in a statement on Facebook. \"The attack blocked almost every file in the data center.

Today, sources have told BleepingComputer that the cyber attack on Lazio was conducted by a ransomware operation known as RansomEXX. In a redacted ransom note shared from the attack on Lazio, the threat actors state, \"Hello, Lazio!\" and warn the region that their files were encrypted. The ransom note also includes a link to a private dark web page that Lazio can use to negotiate with the ransomware gang. The ransom note does not state what operation conducted the attack but the ONION URL listed is a known Tor site for the RansomEXX operation. BleepingComputer also received a screenshot of the negotiation page warning that the region must pay a ransom to decrypt their files. The threat actors gave no ransom demand. RansomEXX negotiation pages are unique per victim, and if the threat actors stole data during the attack, the threat actors provide details on the page, including the amount of data stolen and screenshots of files. In this case, the negotiation page showed no indications that RansomEXX stole any data. After posting our article, Italian security researcher   stated that there is evidence in Italy that the attack was conducted by LockBit 2.0 but could not share further information. BleepingComputer will update this article when more information becomes available. The RansomEXX gang launched their operation originally under the name Defray in 2018.

Last month, security researcher GILLES Lionel   that forces a Windows machine, including a Windows domain controller, to authenticate against a threat actor's malicious NTLM relay server using the Microsoft Encrypting File System Remote Protocol ( ). Threat actors would then relay this authentication request to a targeted domain's Active Directory Certificate Services via HTTP., where the attacker would be given a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT), allowing them to assume the domain controller's identity. After the vector was disclosed, researchers quickly began testing the method and illustrated how easy it was to dump credentials and take over a Windows domain. Using this attack, a threat actor can take complete control over a Windows domain, including pushing out new group policies, scripts, and deploying malware on all devices, such as ransomware. Last week, Microsoft released an advisory titled ' ' that explains how to mitigate NTLM relay attacks. \"To prevent NTLM Relay Attacks on networks with NTLM enabled, domain administrators must ensure that services that permit NTLM authentication make use of protections such as   or signing features such as SMB signing,\" explained Microsoft's advisory. \"PetitPotam takes advantage of servers where Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is not configured with protections for NTLM Relay Attacks. The mitigations outlined in  * instruct customers on how to protect their AD CS servers from such attacks.\" While Microsoft's suggestions may prevent NTLM relay attacks, they do not provide any guidance on blocking PetitPotam, which can be used as a vector for other attacks. \"It can be used for different attacks too like NTLMv1 downgrade and relaying machine account on computers where this machine account is local admin,\" Lionel told BleepingComputer when he first disclosed the attack vector.

The good news is that researchers have figured out a way to block the remote unauthenticated PetitPotam attack vector using NETSH filters without affecting local EFS functionality. NETSH is a Windows command-line utility that allows administrators to configure network interfaces, add filters, and modify the Windows firewall configuration. This weekend,   shared a NETSH RPC filter that blocks remote access to the MS-EFSRPC API,  effectively blocking the unauthenticated PetitPotam attack vector. According to security researcher  , you can use this filter by copying the following contents into a file called 'block_efsr.txt' and saving it on your desktop. Now open an elevated command prompt and type the following command to import the filter using NETSH. You can verify that the filters have been added by running the following command: After running the command, netsh should display two filters, one for c681d488-d850-11d0-8c52-00c04fd90f7e and another for df1941c5-fe89-4e79-bf10-463657acf44d, as shown below. With these filters in place, the PetitPotam vector will no longer work, but EFS will continue to operate normally on the device. If Microsoft ever fixes the API to prevent this vector, you can remove the filters using the following command: The filterkey can be found when displaying the list of configured filters as described above. good to know \nmake a GPO with this filters \nthere's the possibility of registry entries, to get more simple deploy process?

While disinformation and misinformation campaigns run rampant and copycat publishers abound, BleepingComputer takes pride in our investigative and original reporting regarding a wide variety of topics, including cybersecurity, operating systems, computers, software products, and privacy issues.  To maintain our strict editorial independence and original reporting, BleepingComputer operates under the following guidelines: For more detailed information regarding these guidelines, you can read the following sections below. BleepingComputer relies on different sources of information that we use to craft our articles. These sources include end-users, employees, threat actors, corporate reports, research, press releases, and other publisher's stories. We also conduct interviews over the phone, messaging apps, emails, and through video conferencing. During phone and video interviews, we may record the conversation to report on the information provided properly. All discussions are considered to be \"on the record\" unless we are told otherwise, in which case, we will honor that request. Due to the nature of our reporting on cybersecurity and cyberattacks, we also commonly use sources who wish to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from employers or threat actors. When working with sources who wish to remain anonymous, BleepingComputer will always protect their identity to the fullest extent of the law.  Regardless of how we attain our information, BleepingComputer will always independently confirm the accuracy of such information through our own tests, in conversations with the related companies, or through other individuals who have demonstrated that they have first-hand knowledge about the topic. Despite making the best efforts to report on a particular topic or news event accurately, we may sometimes get something wrong. If a mistake is reported to BleepingComputer or we discover it on our own, we will promptly update our content with a correction and provide a statement explaining why we made the change. While covering a story, there are times that the report may be developing and new information becomes available at a later date. When that occurs, we will update our content and note why BleepingComputer added additional content. At times, BleepingComputer writers are invited to conferences to cover new information presented by companies and researchers.

Kubernetes is a popular open-source solution for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized apps in the cloud, making it an attractive target for cyber attacks. Hackers are constantly hitting Kubernetes environments, their motivation varying from stealing data, to cryptocurrency mining, to denial-of-service (DoS) that could act as a diversion for other operations. To help companies make their Kubernetes environment more difficult to compromise, the NSA and CISA released a 52-page cybersecurity technical report that offers guidance for admins to manage Kubernetes securely. The NSA says that the main three causes for a compromised Kubernetes environment are supply-chain attacks, malicious actors, and insider threats. While administrators can’t prevent all three risks, they can harden the security of a Kubernetes cluster by avoiding common misconfigurations and applying mitigations to minimize security risks. The agency notes that supply-chain attacks “are often challenging to mitigate,” adding that a malicious threat actor’s way in is typically exploiting a vulnerability or leveraging misconfigurations. “Insider threats can be administrators, users, or cloud service providers. Insiders with special access to an organization’s Kubernetes infrastructure may be able to abuse these privileges” - the  In broad strokes, the defensive actions against this these threats is to scan containers and Pods for bugs and misconfigurations; use the least privileges to run run Pods and containers (unless higher permissions are needed), and use network separation, strong authentication, properly configured firewalls, and audit logs. Admins should also review all Kubernetes settings regularly and ensure that the system benefits from the latest updates, patches, and available upgrades.

However, Cobalt Strike is also used by threat actors (commonly seen used during ransomware attacks) for post-exploitation tasks after deploying so-called beacons, which provide them with persistent remote access to compromised devices. Using these beacons, the attackers can later access the breached servers to harvest data or deploy second-stage malware payloads. SentinelLabs (the threat research team at SentinelOne) found the DoS vulnerabilities collectively tracked as   (and dubbed  ) in the latest versions of Cobalt Strike's server. As they discovered, one can register fake beacons with the server of a particular Cobalt Strike installation. By sending fake tasks (or abnormally large screenshots) to the server, one can crash the server by exhausting available memory. The crash can render already installed beacons unable to communicate with the C2 server, block new beacons from being installed on infiltrated systems, and interfere with ongoing red team (or malicious) operations that used the deployed beacons. \"This lets a malicious actor cause memory exhaustion on the machine the Cobalt's server (the 'Teamserver') runs on, which makes the server unresponsive until it's restarted,\"  . \"This means that live beacons cannot communicate to their C2 until the operators restart the server. Restarting, however, won't be enough to defend against this vulnerability as it is possible to repeatedly target the server until it is patched or the beacon's configuration is changed.\" Since Cobalt Strike is also heavily used by threat actors for various nefarious purposes, law enforcement and security researchers can also employ the Hotcobalt vulnerabilities to take down malicious infrastructure. On April 20, SentinelLabs has disclosed the vulnerabilities to CobaltStrike's parent company HelpSystems, who addressed them in Cobalt Strike 4.4, released earlier today. HelpSystems also advises those who cannot immediately update to the last Cobalt Strike version to harden their C2 infrastructure by: 04/20/2021 - Initial contact with HelpSystems for issue disclosure. \n04/22/2021 - Issue details disclosed to HelpSystems. \n04/23/2021 - HelpSystems confirmed the issue and asked for an extension until August 3rd. \n04/28/2021 - SentinelOne accepted the extension. \n07/18/2021 - Submitted CVE request to MITRE. \n07/19/2021 - CVE-2021-36798 was assigned and reserved for the specified issue. \n08/02/2021 - SentinelOne shared the publication date and post for review. \n08/02/2021 - HelpSystems reviewed and confirmed the post for publication. \n08/04/2021 - HelpSystems released Cobalt Strike 4.4, which contains a fix for CVE-2021-36798.

This is because its scanning technology not only incorporates its own virus definitions but also has the ability to scan files on your computer with the definitions of 5 other anti-virus vendors. A strong feature of HitmanPro is its Scan Cloud feature.  This feature comes into play when HitmanPro detects a suspicious file that they are unsure of.  When a suspicious file is detected, HitmanPro will upload the file to their cloud where it will then be scanned by 5 other anti-virus vendors.  Using the scan results from these vendors, HitmanPro will then decide when or not that file should be classified as malware and removed.  This approach is very effective as it allows a more thorough approach to detecting new malware. HitmanPro also includes the ability to create a bootable USB drive that contains HitmanPro.Kickstart.  Kickstart is a full featured version of HitmanPro that can be run directly from the bootable USB drive.  This makes it very useful for removing stubborn infections, such as Ransomware, that corrupt Windows Safe Mode or disable your ability to access the Windows Desktop. HitmanPro is a second opinion scanner, designed to rescue your computer from malware (viruses, trojans, rootkits, etc.) that have infected your computer despite all the security measures you have taken (such as anti virus software, firewalls, etc.). \nResearch shows that computers are still run a chance of getting infected because the existing anti virus program is not giving you a 100% protection. \"32% of computers infected, despite presence of anti virus program.\" Read more... \nJust relying on a single vendor is not sufficient to completely protect you. You do need a second source to make sure you are secure. But in most cases, installing a second anti virus program is not a viable solution. Two programs are effecting the performance of the computer dramatically, and sometimes even conflict causing the computer to crash. \nHitmanPro is designed to work alongside existing security programs without any conflicts. It scans the computer quickly (less than 5 minutes) and does not slow down the computer (except for the few minutes it is scanning). HitmanPro does not need to be installed. It can be run straight from a USB flash drive, a CD/DVD, local or network attached hard drive. \nHitmanPro offers you a Free Scan for a second opinion. It is designed to check if your security measures work. If nothing is found (and we sincerely hope so), then you will never need a license. When a virus is found, then you will receive a free 30-day license to remove the threat. AdwCleaner is a free program that searches for and deletes Adware, Toolbars, Pot...

In addition to standard definitions based malware detections, Sophos Home also utilizes signature-less behavioral­-based heuristics, a Host Intrusion Protection System (HIPS), malicious url blocking, and web filtering. What I really like about Sophos home, though, is the ability to manage all of the computers under your account from one online dashboard.. This also allows you to not only install and manage Sophos Home on your own network, but also on computers for family members at other locations.  Once someone installs the client on their computer, you can then manage their security and see security alerts from the dashboard. Now when your parent or family member calls you and says that their antivirus detected something, you can quickly login to the dashboard and see what was found. In order to use Sophos Home, you first need to register a free account at the Sophos Home website, which can be reached using the download button above. Once you register an account you can login and click on the Add Device button to retrieve a unique installation URL for your account. This link can then be used by you or family members to install Sophos Home and automatically have their computer's added to your dashboard. For those looking for an antivirus and security protection solution where you can manage multiple computers form one dashboard, you could not go wrong with Sophos Home.

When installed, this extension causes any searches made from the address\nbar to be redirected through a series of sites that record information\nabout what you are searching. When performing the redirects, your browser will first go to\ntoksearches.xyz, then smashapps.net, then smashappsearch.com, and then\nfinally to Yahoo, who will display the search results. This extension will also prevent you from accessing the extension's\nChrome Web Store page, and will redirect you to Google when you attempt to\ndo so. The BipApp\nextension is currently being distributed using advertisements similar to\nthe one below. It has not been seen being installed via adware bundles or\nother programs. These advertisements are either shown by site that open\npopups or new tabs to these pages or via adware. Since this extension modifies the default search of the Chrome browser\nand redirects searches to yahoo.com, you may as well just use yahoo.com\ndirectly rather than a 3rd party. If you do not wish to use this\nextension, you can remove BipApp for free  .  If you are unsure how this extension was installed or are concerned other\nextensions or unwanted programs may be installed on your computer, you can\nuse the removal guide below instead. This removal guide may appear overwhelming due to the amount of the steps and numerous programs that will be used. It was only written this way to provide clear, detailed, and easy to understand instructions that anyone can use to remove this infection for free. Before using this guide, we suggest that you read it once and download all necessary tools to your desktop. After doing so, please print this page as you may need to close your browser window or reboot your computer. To terminate any programs that may interfere with the removal process we must first download the Rkill program. Rkill will search your computer for active malware infections and attempt to terminate them so that they wont interfere with the removal process. To do this, please download RKill to your desktop from the following link. When at the download page, click on the   button labeled  . When you are prompted where to save it, please save it on your  . Once it is downloaded, double-click on the   icon in order to automatically attempt to stop any processes associated with   and other malware. Please be patient while the program looks for various malware programs and ends them. When it has finished, the black window will automatically close and a log file will open. Please review the log file and then close so you can continue with the next step. If you have problems running RKill, you can download the other renamed versions of RKill from the  . All of the files are renamed copies of RKill, which you can try instead. Please note that the download page will open in a new browser window or tab. At this point you should download Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, or MBAM, to scan your computer for any infections, adware, or potentially unwanted programs that may be present. Please download Malwarebytes from the following location and save it to your desktop: Once downloaded, close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one. Double-click on the icon on your desktop named  . This will start the installation of MBAM onto your computer. When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, a welcome screen will be displayed. At this screen, click on the   button where you will be prompted to buy and activate a license. To continue using it for free, click on the 'Maybe Later' option and then select 'Use Malwarebytes Free'.  It should be noted that the free version will scan for and remove malware, but not provide real-time protection from threats that occur when not performing a scan. Finally, you will be shown a screen asking you to sign up for their newsletter. Just click on the 'Open Malwarebytes Free' option to start the program. MBAM will now start and you will be at the main screen as shown below. We now need to enable rootkit scanning to detect the largest amount of malware and unwanted programs that is possible with MalwareBytes. To do this, click on the   gear on the top left side of the screen and you will be brought to the general settings section. Now click on the  option at the top of the screen. You will now be shown the settings MalwareBytes will use when scanning your computer. Scroll down until you see Scan option as shown below. At this screen, please enable the   setting by clicking on the toggle switch so it turns blue. Now that you have enabled rootkit scanning, click on the   button to close the settings to get back to the main screen. You should now click on the   button to begin scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan to see when it is finished. When MBAM is finished scanning it will display a screen that displays any malware, adware, or potentially unwanted programs that it has detected. Please note that our guide's scan results image may look different than the one you are shown in this version of Malwarebytes as it was created with an older version. You should now click on the  button to remove all the selected items. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the program's quarantine. When removing the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps. You can now exit the MBAM program. At this point you should download Zemana AntiMalware, or ZAM, in order to scan your computer for any any infections, adware, or potentially unwanted programs that may be present. Please download Zemana AntiMalware from the following location and save it to your desktop: Once downloaded, close all programs and open windows on your computer. Now double-click on the icon on your desktop named  . This will start the installation of Zemana AntiMalware onto your computer. When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, Zemana will automatically start and display the main screen. You will now be at the main screen for Zemana AntiMalware as shown below. Above the Scan button, please change the scan type to   and then click on the   button to start the malware removal scan. Zemana AntiMalware will now start scanning your computer for malware, adware, and potentially unwanted programs. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan to see when it is finished.

Fabian Wosar, of Emsisoft, further analyzed the infection and was able to find a weakness in the encryption algorithm so that victim's can recover their files for free. A new ransomware is in the wild that has been dubbed Gomasom (GOogle MAil ranSOM) by Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft due to its use of gmail email addresses in the encrypted file names. This ransomware is particularly destructive as it will not only encrypt data files but will also encrypt executables. A new ransomware has been discovered called the Radamant Ransomware Kit that encrypts your data using AES-256 encryption and requires you to pay .5 Bitcoins, or approximately $230.88 USD, to get your files back. Any files encrypted by this ransomware will have the RDM extension added to them. A new zero-day vulnerability was discovered for the Grub bootloader that allows attackers to bypass Grub password authentication. A security notice released by researchers Hector Marco & Ismael Ripoll states that Grub versions 1.98 (December, 2009) through 2.02 (December, 2015) are affected by this bug. A new ransomware called the XRTN Ransomware is in the wild that encrypts your data with RSA-1024 encryption using the open source Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) encryption software. This ransomware is part of the same family as the VaultCrypt ransomware that we reported on in March. A man has been arrested by officers from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit as part of the investigation into the hack on VTech servers. As reported earlier this month, the personal information of close to 5 million parents and 200,000 children was accessed by a hacker who broke into VTech's servers. Google has released version 47.0.2526.106 of Google Chrome today to resolve two Google discovered security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are identified as CVE-2015-6792 and these private security issues from internal audits and fuzzing and are mentioned in issue 569486. Sophos has announced the purchase of Netherlands based security software company SurfRight for $31.8 million.  HitmanPro has a history of developing innovative malware removal, APT remediation, and zero-day exploit protection solutions that will be used to strengthen the end point protection in Sophos' products. Unsecured MongoDB database servers allowed a \"white-hat\" hacker to access the account information for over 13 million MacKeeper users. MacKeeper is a program that supposedly optimizes your Mac so that it runs faster and safer.. A new version of TeslaCrypt was released on Tuesday that contains some minor changes such as new ransom note names, a new name for the autorun entry, and a slight change to how it removes the Shadow Volume Copies. In protest of the arrests of over 200 protesters at the Global Climate March in Paris, Anonymous has leaked account information for over 1,400 UN officials. This information includes login credentials, phone numbers, email address, and names. Microsoft released an advisory yesterday about an accidental leak of their xboxlive.com SSL certificate's private key. This would potentially allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to sniff the encrypted communication. Not to be outdone by Adobe or Microsoft, Apple also released security updates today for all it's core products including Xcode, Safari, watchOS, tvOS, OS X El Capitan, and iOS. These updates resolve 80 different vulnerability ranging from remote code execution to the ability to access a user's keychain items. Any users of Apple produ Adobe has released an update for Adobe Flash that resolves a whopping 78 vulnerabilities. This is a required update for anyone who has Flash installed as these vulnerabilities are known to be used in the wild to install malware and other attacks. Today Microsoft released their October Patch Tuesday updates that consists of 12 security updates, with eight of them being marked as critical due to vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution. All Windows users should install these security updates immediately. Heimdall Security has discovered that a large campaign utilizing the Angler Exploit kit is underway that is distributing CryptoWall 4.0 along with other malware. This campaign utilizes hacked websites that have been compromised to display the Angler exploit kit to unwitting visitors. A security breach in VTech has allowed a hacker to get the personal information of about 5 million parents and over 200,000 children. To make matters worse, it was discovered this weekend that picture's of children who use the VTech service and their text messages with their parents were obtained as well. A new version of the TeslaCrypt ransomware has been released that changes the ransom note filenames and uses the new .vvv extension for encrypted files. Unfortunately, at this time there is still no way of decrypting files encrypted by this version of TeslaCrypt. CryptoWall 4.0 has been discovered being installed via the Nuclear Exploit kit. As an added twist, the malware payload is also being delivered as a NSIS installer that when executed installs the CryptoWall 4.0 ransomware. A new file-encrypting ransomware has been floating around this past week called CryptInfinite or DecryptorMax. At first this ransomware looked secure, but with further analysis by Fabian Wosar, it was discovered that a decrypter could be made that would recover your files for free.

The stack is commonly found on real-time operating systems (RTOS) powering operational technology (OT) and industrial control system (ICS) devices to provide internet and network functionality. INFRA:HALT is a set of 14 vulnerabilities jointly discovered by Forescout Research Labs and JFrog Security Research. It is part of Forescout's   Research ( ,  ,  ) that focuses on the security of TCP/IP stacks. The bugs range from remote code execution, denial of service (DoS), and information leak to TCP spoofing and DNS cache poisoning. Most are high-severity security issues, but two of them - CVE-2020-25928 and CVE-2020-31226 - are deemed critical. Forescout researchers assessed their severity score at 9.8 and 9.1, respectively. They impact the DNS client and the HTTP server components of the stack, allowing a remote attacker to execute code on the vulnerable device to take full control over it. To trigger CVE-2020-25928, an attacker would need to send a crafted DNS packet as a response to a DNS query from the vulnerable device, Forescout and   in a joint   published earlier today. Stanislav Dashevskyi, one of the Forescout researchers that investigated the INFRA:HALT collection of vulnerabilities, demonstrated CVE-2020-25928 in a video by attacking the programmable logical controller (PLC) managing an industrial fan. Not long after initiating the attack, the PLC could no longer activate the fan and needed a restart to regain control over the fan. The attack requires only four steps to crash the PLC: Of the 14 INFRA:HALT vulnerabilities, ten have been rated with a high-severity score, two are low severity and two are critical:   NicheStack, also known as InterNiches, is maintained by HCC Embedded. The library is present in devices from around 200 vendors. An   version from the company lists big names among its customers: Emerson, Honeywell, Mitsubishi Electric, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, and Siemens. A search on Shodan on March 8 revealed that more than 6,400 devices running a vulnerable version of the stack. The number is likely lower today. Looking at data collected from its appliances monitoring more than 13 million customer devices, Forescout found 2,500 systems from 21 vendors to be vulnerable to INFRA:HALT. Almost half (46%) of these devices were deployed in industrial control systems in the Energy and Power sector. A quarter of them were in the VoIP industry and 18% were in the networking sector. HCC Embedded has addressed all INFRA:HALT vulnerabilities with   that are available on request.

In return, the insider is promised million-dollar payouts. Many ransomware gangs operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service, which consists of a core group of developers, who maintain the ransomware and payment sites, and recruited affiliates who breach victims' networks and encrypt devices. Any ransom payments that victims make are then split between the core group and the affiliate, with the affiliate usually receiving 70-80% of the total amount. However, in many cases, the affiliates purchase access to networks from other third-party pentesters rather than breaching the company themselves. With LockBit 2.0, the ransomware gang is trying to remove the middle-man and instead recruit insiders to provide them access to a corporate network. In June, the LockBit ransomware operation announced the   ransomware-as-a-service. This relaunch included redesigned Tor sites and numerous advanced features, including automatically  . With this relaunch, LockBit has also changed the Windows wallpaper placed on encrypted devices to offer \"millions of dollars\" for corporate insiders who provide access to networks where they have an account. The full text, with the contact information redacted, explains that LockBit is looking for RDP, VPN, corporate email credentials that they can then use to gain access to the network. The ransomware gang also says they will send the insider a \"virus\" that should be executed on a computer, likely to give the ransomware gang remote access to the network. \"Would you like to earn millions of dollars? \nOur company acquire access to networks of various companies, as well as insider information that can help you steal the most valuable data of any company. \nYou can provide us accounting data for the access to any company, for example, login and password to RDP, VPN, corporate email, etc. Open our letter at your email. Launch the provided virus on any computer in your company. \nCompanies pay us the foreclosure for the decryption of files and prevention of data leak. \nYou can communicate with us through the Tox messenger \nhttps://tox.chat/download.html \nUsing Tox messenger, we will never know your real name, it means your privacy is guaranteed. \nIf you want to contact us, use ToxID: xxxx\" When we first saw this message, it seemed counterintuitive to recruit an insider for a network already been breached. However, this message is likely targeting external IT consultants who may see the message while responding to an attack. While this tactic may sound far-fetched, it is not the first time threat actors attempted to recruit an employee to encrypt their company's network.

Read our   to learn what content is prohibited.The LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang is actively recruiting corporate insiders to help them breach and encrypt networks. In return, the insider is promised million-dollar payouts. Many ransomware gangs operate as a Ransomware-as-a-Service, which consists of a core group of developers, who maintain the ransomware and payment sites, and recruited affiliates who breach victims' networks and encrypt devices. Any ransom payments that victims make are then split between the core group and the affiliate, with the affiliate usually receiving 70-80% of the total amount. However, in many cases, the affiliates purchase access to networks from other third-party pentesters rather than breaching the company themselves. With LockBit 2.0, the ransomware gang is trying to remove the middle-man and instead recruit insiders to provide them access to a corporate network. In June, the LockBit ransomware operation announced the   ransomware-as-a-service. This relaunch included redesigned Tor sites and numerous advanced features, including automatically  . With this relaunch, LockBit has also changed the Windows wallpaper placed on encrypted devices to offer \"millions of dollars\" for corporate insiders who provide access to networks where they have an account. The full text, with the contact information redacted, explains that LockBit is looking for RDP, VPN, corporate email credentials that they can then use to gain access to the network. The ransomware gang also says they will send the insider a \"virus\" that should be executed on a computer, likely to give the ransomware gang remote access to the network. When we first saw this message, it seemed counterintuitive to recruit an insider for a network already been breached. However, this message is likely targeting external IT consultants who may see the message while responding to an attack. While this tactic may sound far-fetched, it is not the first time threat actors attempted to recruit an employee to encrypt their company's network.

Telegram offers an optional 'Secret Chat' mode that increases the privacy of chats by enabling a variety of additional features. When you start a Secret Chat with another Telegram user, the connection will become end-to-end encrypted, and all messages, attachments, and media will be set to automatically self-destruct and be removed from all devices after a certain period. However, new bugs discovered by Reegun Richard Jayapaul, Trustwave SpiderLabs' Lead Threat Architect, allow Telegram for Mac users to save self-destructing messages and attachments forever. When media files, other than attachments, are sent in a message, they are saved in a cache folder located at the following path, with the XXXXXX unique numbers associated with an account. Telegram will not download attachments (documents like text, doc, or pdf files, and Audio and video) unless a recipient attempts to open them. This is likely done due to the larger size of attachments. When a recipient reads the message or views the content, the self-destruct timer will start, and when finished, the content will be automatically be deleted. However, Reegun discovered that the self-destructing media was not deleted from the cache folder, and a user could save it to another location on their hard drive. This bug was fixed by Telegram for macOS in version 7.7 (215786) or later after it was responsibly reported, but there's an additional bug that lets you save self-destructible media. As voice recordings, video messages, images, or location sharing images are automatically downloaded to the cache, Reegun discovered that a user could simply copy the media from the cache folder before viewing it in the program. \"Bob sends a media message to Alice (whether voice recordings, video messages, images, or location sharing). Without opening the message, since it may self-destruct, Alice instead goes to the cache folder and grabs the media file,\" Reegun explains in his report. \"She can also delete the messages from the folder without reading them in the app. Regardless, Bob will not know whether Alice has read the message, and Alice will retain a permanent copy of the media.\" Telegram told Reegun that this second bug would not be fixed as there is no way to protect against direct access to the app's folder. \"Please note that the primary purpose of the self-destruct timer is to serve as a simple way to auto-delete individual messages. However, there  are some ways to work around it that are outside what the Telegram app  an control (like copying the app’s folder), and we clearly warn users about such circumstances:  \" - Telegram. Reegun told BleepingComputer that he disagrees and that Telegram could fix the bug by treating all self-destructing media the same way as attachments and not download them to the local file system until they are opened. In February, security researcher Dhiraj Mishra   in the Secret Chat feature that caused self-destructing media not to be deleted from recipients' devices. \"This is a similar bug, but the media was left in an entirely different file location. This researcher’s findings were patched in Telegram v7.4, while our researcher’s findings weren’t fully patched until v7.7,\"  Karl Sigler, Senior Security Research Manager, Trustwave SpiderLabs, told BleepingComputer. \"It’s apparent that Telegram has a history of leaving these supposedly “Self-Destruct” media files behind.\" BleepingComputer has contacted Telegram about the bug to ask why this fix is not being instituted but has not heard back.

Read our   to learn what content is prohibited.​Researchers have discovered a way for users on Telegram for Mac to keep specific self-destructing messages forever or view them without the sender ever knowing. Telegram offers an optional 'Secret Chat' mode that increases the privacy of chats by enabling a variety of additional features. When you start a Secret Chat with another Telegram user, the connection will become end-to-end encrypted, and all messages, attachments, and media will be set to automatically self-destruct and be removed from all devices after a certain period. However, new bugs discovered by Reegun Richard Jayapaul, Trustwave SpiderLabs' Lead Threat Architect, allow Telegram for Mac users to save self-destructing messages and attachments forever. When media files, other than attachments, are sent in a message, they are saved in a cache folder located at the following path, with the XXXXXX unique numbers associated with an account. Telegram will not download attachments (documents like text, doc, or pdf files, and Audio and video) unless a recipient attempts to open them. This is likely done due to the larger size of attachments. When a recipient reads the message or views the content, the self-destruct timer will start, and when finished, the content will be automatically be deleted. However, Reegun discovered that the self-destructing media was not deleted from the cache folder, and a user could save it to another location on their hard drive.

The enterprise is increasingly moving to virtual machines for their servers for better resource management and disaster recovery. With VMware ESXi being the most popular virtual machine platform, almost every enterprise-targeting ransomware operation has begun to release encryptors that specifically target its virtual machines. Yesterday, security researcher   found a Linux ELF64 encryptor [ ] for the   that specifically targets VMware ESXi servers based on its functionality.

After researchers found samples, it was determined that the encryption routines used by the ransomware were the same custom and unique ones used by DarkSide. DarkSide shut down after   and then feeling the total pressure of international enforcement and the US government. From the sample BlackMatter's Linux encryptor shared with BleepingComputer, it is clear that it was designed solely to target VMWare ESXi servers. Advanced Intel's     and told BleepingComputer that the threat actors created an 'esxi_utils' library that is used to perform various operations on VMware ESXi servers Kremez told us that each function would execute a different command using the esxcli command-line management tool, such as listing VMs, stopping the firewall, stopping a VM, and more. For example, stop_firewall() function will execute the following command: While the stop_vm() will execute the following esxcli command: All ransomware that targets ESXi servers attempts to shut down virtual machines before encrypting the drives. This is done to prevent data from being corrupted while it is encrypted. Once all the VMs are shut down, it will encrypt files that match specific file extensions based on the configuration included with the ransomware. Targeting ESXi servers is very efficient when conducting ransomware attacks, as it allows the threat actors to encrypt numerous servers at once with a single command. As more businesses move to this type of platform for their servers, we will continue to see ransomware developers focus primarily on Windows machines but also create a dedicated Linux encrypted targeting ESXi.

Among the malware families that Prometheus TDS has dished out so far are BazarLoader, IcedID, QBot, SocGholish, Hancitor, and Buer Loader, all of them commonly used in intermediary attack stages to download more damaging payloads. A traffic direction system (TDS) allows redirecting users to content based on specific characteristics (e.g. location, language, device type) that determine further action. Threat actors have been using such tools for more than a decade. A 2011   details an upgrade of the Koobface botnet with a TDS component that increased profits by driving traffic to affiliate advertising websites. Researchers at cybersecurity company   that the Prometheus TDS malware-as-a-service (MaaS) operation is being advertised on underground forums since at least August 2020 for $250 per month. A user called Main is promoting it as a “professional redirect system” with anti-bot protection that is suitable for email marketing, generating traffic, and social engineering. Prometheus uses a network of websites infected with a backdoor accessible from the service’s administration panel, where customers can create a profile for their targets. The researchers say that users can be redirected to a website infected with Prometheus.Backdoor through an email campaign delivering an HTML file with a redirect, or a link to a web shell leading to a compromised site, or a Google document pointing to the malicious URL. When users land on the hacked website, the PHP-based Prometheus.Backdoor collects the connection details (IP address, user agent, referrer header, time zone, language) and forwards them to the admin panel. “If the user is not recognized as a bot, then, depending on the configuration, the administrative panel can send a command to redirect the user to the specified URL, or to send a malicious file. The payload file is sent using a special JavaScript code“ -  The malicious code is often hidden in malicious Microsoft Word or Excel documents, although ZIP and RAR archives have also been used. During their investigation, the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team found more than 3,000 target email addresses in campaigns that used Prometheus TDS. Some of the targeted inboxes belonged to U.S. government agencies, companies, and corporations in the banking and finance, retail, energy and mining, cybersecurity, healthcare, IT, and insurance sectors. When investigating the Prometheus TDS malware distribution campaigns, the researchers found dozens of malicious Office documents that delivered Campo Loader (a.k.a. BazarLoader), Hancitor, QBot, IcedID, Buer Loader, and SocGholish. All of the above trojans are malware downloaders involved over the past year in earlier stages of a ransomware attack ( ,  , Egregor,  ,  ,  , Conti). However, the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team told BleepingComputer that they could not link the Prometheus TDS to ransomware attacks because they examined the malicious files in a virtual environment. “Group-IB researchers examined the extracted malicious files in the virtual environment, while ransomware operators now tend to be selective, which means that after the network compromise they proceed with the lateral movement to find out more about the compromised company and decide whether it’s worth to encrypt its network. So possibly the virtual machines didn't seem attractive enough to the cybercriminals” - Group-IB After downloading the malware, some of the malicious documents redirected users to legitimate websites (DocuSign, USPS), to mask the malware infection. Apart from malware, Prometheus TDS has also been used to redirect users to sites offering fake VPN solutions, selling pharmaceutical products (Viagra spam), or phishing pages for banking information. Whoever is behind Prometheus is also running another service called BRChecker - a password brute-force tool, which shared the infrastructure used by the TDS service. Group-IB found advertisements for BRChecker as old as mid-June 2018 from a user called Mainin, a handle very similar to the one promoting Prometheus. The researchers told BleepingComputer that the overlaps in functionality and infrastructure indicate that both services have the same developer.

Technical details and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a new    (CVE-2021-34527) was accidentally disclosed in June. This vulnerability allows remote code execution and local privilege escalation by installing malicious printer drivers. While Microsoft   for the remote code execution portion, researchers quickly bypassed the local privilege elevation component. Since then, Security researcher and Mimikatz creator   has been devising   that remain unpatched. These are critical vulnerabilities as they   on a local device, even a Domain Controller, simply by connecting to a remote Internet-accessible print server and installing a malicious print driver. Once a threat actor gains SYSTEM privileges, it is game over for the system. If this is done on a Domain Controller, then the threat actor now effectively controls the Windows Domain. Mitigations for the zero-day PrintNightmare vulnerabilities are already available through the ' ' group policy, which allows you to specify a white list of approved print servers that can be used to install a print driver. Enabling this policy, along with a fake server name, will effectively block Delpy's exploits as the print server will be blocked. However, for those who want to install a patch and not try to understand advisories and fiddle with group policies, the   has released a free micropatch that can be used to fix all known PrintNightmare vulnerabilities. \"We therefore decided to implement the group policy-based workaround as a micropatch, blocking Point and Print printer driver installation from untrusted servers. This workaround employs Group Policy settings: the \"Only use Package Point and Print\" first requires every printer driver is in form of a signed package, while the \"Package Point and print - Approved servers\" limits the set of servers from which printer driver packages are allowed to be installed.\" Kolsek explains in a  . \"These settings are configurable via registry. Our patch modifies function DoesPolicyAllowPrinterConnectionsToServer in win32spl.dll such that it believes that PackagePointAndPrintOnly and PackagePointAndPrintServerList values exist and are set to 1, which enables both policies and keeps the list of approved servers empty.\" You need to register a 0patch account and then install an agent on your Windows device to install the patch. Once installed, 0patch will automatically protect you from the PrintNightmare vulnerability and other unpatched bugs. In a test by BleepingComputer, once installed, if you attempt to install Delpy's malicious PrintNightmare driver, a message will appear stating that a policy has blocked the computer from connecting to the print queue, as shown below. While 0patch is an essential tool for blocking unpatched vulnerabilities, Delpy says that, in this particular case,   that blocks exploitation of all known PrintNightmare bugs might be a better approach. \"If you push binaries to a computer to push settings … you can also push settings,\" Delpy told BleepingComputer. \"Doing so avoids altering process in memory, always a dangerous stuff that security product don't like (and MS does not support...).\" Great info. \nA comment: \n\"Doing so avoids altering process in memory, always a dangerous stuff that security product don't like (and MS does not support...).\" \nReleasing Zero days without clear mitigation plans available to customers is many times more dangerous. Expecting Users to understand and apply settings at home through domain policies- Ridiculous. \nAt least mom and pop can run 0patch and get covered when these software updates are not available. These patches aren't dangerous- they are small and thus trivial to code-inspect for problems, and ONLY touch the code in question. This allows patches to beat the releases to the punch because of the reduced regression risk. This reduces risk for everyone involved including Delphy. Delphy should think about releasing 0patches with his research. That gets Microsoft going while protecting people from the collateral damage of his research. Home users shouldn't need these mitigations in most cases, tho. \nTo be affected, they would need to connect to infected print servers...  \nThis is something to fear in enterprises, since it's a SYSTEM scalation that could easily spread laterally, but only if the print server was compromised in the first place. The threat actors need to deploy a malicious print driver with trusted Authenticode cert., mostly by infecting the print servers if they were exposed to internet, or as a \"step\" to just grow on the network that is already infected. That said, MS SHOULD need release a fix (a complete one) via WU, and not as a mitigation in a KB article.  0Patch releasing this is great and I applaud them for giving it away for free, but since this is a enterprise issue, I wish they had a way to roll this out via GPO.

This playbook matches the active cases for Conti as we see right now,\" Kremez told BleepingComputer in a conversation. \"By and large, it is the holy grail of the pentester operation behind the Conti ransomware \"pentester\" team from A-Z. The implications are huge and allow new pentester ransomware operators to level up their pentester skills for ransomware step by step.\" \"The leak also shows the maturity of their ransomware organization and how sophisticated, meticulous and experienced they are while targeting corporations worldwide.\" \"It also provides a plethora detection opportunities including the group focus on AnyDesk persistence and Atera security software agent persistence to survive detections.\" This leak illustrates the vulnerability of ransomware-as-a-service operations, as a singly unhappy affiliate could lead to the exposure of carefully cultivated information and resources used in attacks. Recently the United States government announced that its Rewards for Justice program is now accepting tips on foreign malicious cyberactivity against U.S. critical infrastructure, with a potential  . Additionally, rewards through this program may be done anonymously in cryptocurrency, which could incentivize low-paid affiliates to turn on other cybercriminals. A source told BleepingComputer that Conti banned the pentester after learning he was poaching business away from their operation by promoting a different unidentified affiliate program. After being banned, the affiliate leaked Conti's training material and tools as revenge.", "title": "Angry Conti ransomware affiliate leaks gang's attack playbook"},

(also known as managed DNS providers) provide DNS renting services to other organizations that do not want to manage and secure yet another network asset on their own. As revealed   by cloud security firm Wiz researchers Shir Tamari and Ami Luttwak, these DNS flaws provide threat actors with nation-state intelligence harvesting capabilities with a simple domain registration. The exploitation process is quite simple, as they explained: they registered a domain and used it to hijack a DNSaaS provider's nameserver (in their case, Amazon Route 53) which enabled them to wiretap on dynamic DNS traffic streaming from Route 53 customers' networks. \"We found a simple loophole that allowed us to intercept a portion of worldwide dynamic DNS traffic going through managed DNS providers like Amazon and Google,\" the Wiz researchers said. \"The dynamic DNS traffic we 'wiretapped' came from over 15,000 organizations, including Fortune 500 companies, 45 U.S. government agencies, and 85 international government agencies.\" The data they harvested this way ranged from employee/computer names and locations to highly sensitive details regarding organizations' infrastructure, including Internet-exposed network devices. In one case, the researchers mapped the office locations of one of the world's largest services companies using network traffic received from 40,000 corporate endpoints. The information collected this way would make threat actors' job of breaching an organization's network a lot easier as it will give them \"a bird's eye view on what's happening inside companies and governments\" and provide them with \"nation-state level spying capability.\" The researchers haven't found evidence that the DNS vulnerability they uncovered was previously exploited in the wild before, but, as they explain, anyone with knowledge of the issues and the skills to abuse it \"could have collected data undetected for over a decade.\" \"The impact is huge. Out of six major DNSaaS providers we examined, three were vulnerable to nameserver registration,\" they  . \"Any cloud provider, domain registrar, and website host who provides DNSaaS could be vulnerable.\" What makes things even worse, while two of the major DNS providers (Google and Amazon) have already fixed these DNS flaws, others are still likely vulnerable, exposing millions of devices to attacks. Furthermore, it's not precisely clear who should fix this critical DNS bug. Microsoft, who could tweak the dynamic DNS algorithm which allows Windows endpoints to leak internal network traffic to malicious DNS servers, already told Wiz that this is not a vulnerability.

Government partners already participating include the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Cyber Command, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, with additional Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) to join the effort at a later time. We will: \nShare insight to shape our understanding of cyber defense challenges and opportunities; \nDesign whole-of-nation cyber defense plans to address risks; \nSupport joint exercises to improve cyber defense operations; \nImplement coordinated defensive cyber operations.

The commonly used \"net\" library in Go and Rust languages is also impacted by the mixed-format IP address validation vulnerability. The bug has to do with how \"net\" treats IP addresses as decimal, even when they are provided in a mixed (octal-decimal) format, and therefore making applications vulnerable to SSRF and RFI. A mysterious, one-letter npm package named \"-\" sitting on the registry since 2020 has received over 700,000 downloads. What's more? The package contains no functional code, so what makes it score so many downloads? Node.js has released updates for a high severity vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to crash the process and cause unexpected behaviors. The use-after-free vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22930 is to do with how HTTP2 streams are handled in the language. The Python Package Index (PyPI) registry has removed several Python packages this week aimed at stealing users' credit card numbers, Discord tokens, and granting arbitrary code execution capabilities to attackers. These malicious packages were downloaded over 30,000 times according to the researchers who caught them. Northern Ireland's Department of Health (DoH) has temporarily halted its COVID-19 vaccine certification web service and mobile apps following a data exposure incident. Signal has fixed a serious bug in its Android app that, in some cases, sent random unintended pictures to contacts without an obvious explanation. Although the issue was reported in December 2020, given the difficulty of reproducing the bug, it isn't until this month that a fix was pushed out. Major news sites including The Washington Post, New York Magazine, and HuffPost, saw their stories now displaying porn videos instead of the once-embedded intended ones. The fiasco happened as prominent websites relied on the now-defunct domain vid.me to embed streaming videos in their articles. Atlassian is prompting its enterprise customers to patch a critical vulnerability in multiple versions of its Jira Data Center and Jira Service Management Data Center products. The vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-36239 can give remote attackers code execution abilities, due to a missing authentication flaw in Ehcache RMI. New npm malware has been caught stealing credentials from the Google Chrome web browser by using legitimate password recovery tools on Windows systems. Additionally, this malware listens for incoming connections from the attacker's C2 server and provides advanced capabilities, including screen and camera access.  Attackers have stolen 1 TB of proprietary data belonging to Saudi Aramco and are offering it for sale on the darknet. The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, better known as Saudi Aramco, is one of the largest public petroleum and natural gas companies in the world. The sales price, albeit negotiable, is set at $5 million. Cloudflare has fixed a critical vulnerability in its free and open-source CDNJS potentially impacting 12.7% of all websites on the internet. CDNJS serves millions of websites with over 4,000 JavaScript and CSS libraries stored publicly on GitHub, making it the second-largest JavaScript CDN. The author of a popular software-defined radio (SDR) project has removed a \"backdoor\" from radio devices that granted root-level access. The backdoor had been, according to the author, present in all versions of KiwiSDR devices for the purposes of remote administration and debugging. The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has charged an individual for engaging in insider trading on the darknet. Greece-based Apostolos Trovias, known as the \"The Bull\" frequently used encrypted messaging services and the dark web for soliciting, exchanging and selling inside information. Mozilla has decided to roll out the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) feature by default for Canadian Firefox users later this month. The move comes after DoH has already been offered to US-based Firefox users since 2020. Microsoft has once again been successfully hit by a dependency hijacking attack. This month, another researcher found an npm internal dependency being used by an open-source project. After publishing a public dependency by the same name, he began receiving messages from Microsoft's Halo game dev servers.  -   -  Copyright @ 2003 - 2021   - All Rights Reserved Not a member yet?

Email or Twitter DMs for tips. Threat actors actively exploit a critical authentication bypass vulnerability impacting home routers with Arcadyan firmware to take them over and deploy Mirai botnet malicious payloads. A free unofficial patch is now available to block attackers from taking over domain controllers and compromising entire Windows domains via PetitPotam NTLM relay attacks. In a Thursday security advisory update, Cisco revealed that a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ADSM) Launcher disclosed last month is a zero-day bug that has yet to receive a security update. CISA has announced the launch of Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), a partnership across public and private sectors focused on defending US critical infrastructure from ransomware and other cyber threats. Security researchers found a new class of DNS vulnerabilities impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow attackers to access sensitive information from corporate networks. Google says that enforcing two-step verification on Google accounts of Chrome Web Store developers will take longer than expected. Microsoft has announced that the Edge Vulnerability Research team is experimenting with a new feature dubbed \"Super Duper Secure Mode\" and designed to bring security improvements without significant performance losses. Italian energy company ERG reports \"only a few minor disruptions\" affecting its information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure following a ransomware attack on its systems. Cisco has addressed pre-auth security vulnerabilities impacting multiple Small Business VPN routers and allowing remote attackers to trigger a denial of service condition or execute commands and arbitrary code on vulnerable devices. Microsoft has added support for layered Group Policies, which allow IT admins to control what internal or external devices users can be installed on corporate endpoints across their organization's network.\" Security researchers have discovered Cobalt Strike denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities that allow blocking beacon command-and-control (C2) communication channels and new deployments. Microsoft has announced that the Web Application Firewall (WAF) bot protection feature has reached general availability on Azure on Application Gateway starting this week. Microsoft has announced that the Web Application Firewall (WAF) bot protection feature has reached general availability on Azure on Application Gateway starting this week. The FBI Criminal Investigative Division and Securities and Exchange Commission warn investors of fraudsters impersonating registered investment professionals such as investment advisers and registered brokers. The US Department of Justice says that the Microsoft Office 365 email accounts of employees at 27 US Attorneys' offices were breached by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) during the SolarWinds global hacking spree.  -   -  Copyright @ 2003 - 2021   - All Rights Reserved Not a member yet?

If there is one thing we learned this week, it's that not only are corporations vulnerable to insider threats but so are ransomware operations. ​Taiwanese motherboard maker Gigabyte has suffered a RansomEXX ransomware attack where threat actors threaten to release 112 GB of data if a ransom is not paid. ​The BlackMatter gang has joined the ranks of ransomware operations to develop a Linux encryptor that targets VMware's ESXi virtual machine platform. A disgruntled Conti affiliate has leaked the gang's training material when conducting attacks, including information about one of the ransomware's operators. A free unofficial patch has been released to protect Windows users from all new PrintNightmare zero-day vulnerabilities discovered since June. ​Researchers have discovered a way for users on Telegram for Mac to keep specific self-destructing messages forever or view them without the sender ever knowing. The LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang is actively recruiting corporate insiders to help them breach and encrypt networks. In return, the insider is promised million-dollar payouts. Microsoft has suspended free trials of their newly launched Windows 365 Cloud PC service after running out of available servers. The Lazio region in Italy has suffered a reported ransomware attack that has disabled the region's IT systems, including the COVID-19 vaccination registration portal. A planned October 2021 release date for Windows 11 has been accidentally leaked in support documents from both Microsoft and Intel. Google Chrome will no longer show whether a site you are visiting is secure and only show when you visit an insecure website. Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 will automatically block potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) by default starting this month. Microsoft's Windows 365 Cloud PC service is now generally available, allowing businesses to deploy Windows 10 desktops in the cloud for prices ranging between $24 and $162 per device per month. Security researchers have devised a way to block the recently disclosed PetitPotam attack vector that allows hackers to take control of a Windows domain controller easily.  -   -  Copyright @ 2003 - 2021   - All Rights Reserved Not a member yet?

Windows PowerShell includes an interactive prompt and a scripting environment that can be used independently or in combination,\" Microsoft  . Many PowerShell commands, though, require elevated or administrator permissions, and you need to launch an elevated PowerShell prompt to execute them. This guide will provide two methods that you can use to launch an elevated PowerShell administrator prompt. When you right-click on the Windows 10 start menu, a context menu will appear that allows you to launch frequent administrative programs quickly. Included on this context menu is an option called 'Windows PowerShell (Admin)', as shown below. To launch an elevated PowerShell prompt, click on the 'Windows PowerShell (Admin)' option. Windows 10 will now display a UAC prompt asking if you want to give the program elevated permissions. Click ' ' at this prompt. An elevated PowerShell prompt will now open. You can tell it is elevated as the starting directory will be C:\\Windows\\System32 and the window title will be 'Administrator: Windows PowerShell'. When done using the prompt, you can close it by clicking on the X or by typing 'exit' and then pressing enter. If you have an   already open, you can launch a PowerShell shell within it by simply typing ' ' and pressing enter. When launched in this way, the PowerShell prompt will look slightly different as the background will not be blue, and it is running as a shell under the regular command prompt. To exit back to the elevated command prompt, you would type ' ' and press enter.

This mode of operating is designed to let you troubleshoot and run diagnostics on your computer. Windows Safe Mode loads a basic video drivers so your programs may look different than normal. For Win98/ME, XP, Vista and Windows 7 there are two methods of booting into Safe Mode, while 95 and 2000 only have one. We will describe these methods below: By pressing the F8 key right when Windows starts, usually right after you hear your computer beep when you reboot it, you will be brought to a menu where you can choose to boot into safe mode. If it does not work on the first try, reboot and try again as you have to be quick when you press it. I have found that during boot up right after the computer shows you all the equipment , memory, etc installed on your computer, if you start lightly tapping the F8 key you will usually be able to get to the desired menu. You can use the System Configuration Utility, or MSCONFIG, found in Windows 98, ME, XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 to make Windows boot into Safe Mode on the next reboot. We will go into specific details in the sections below. Please note, that you should not force your computer to boot into Safe Mode using the System Configuration Utility if you suspect you are infected with malware as the malware may corrupt keys required to boot into Safe Mode.

Then press the OK button and then the OK button again. Windows 98/ME will now prompt if you would like to reboot as shown in Figure 4 below.     Press the Yes button and your computer will restart into Safe Mode.  When the computer boots up perform what diagnostic or troubleshooting tasks you require.  When you are finished with these tasks, complete steps 1-7 again, but in Step 6 this time uncheck the checkbox labeled \"Enable Startup Menu\". : Reboot the computer back into normal mode. Windows 2000 can only boot into Safe Mode using the F8 method as it does not have a System Configuration Utility.

For reasons why, you should  .   For a detailed tutorial on how to boot Windows 10 into Safe Mode, please see this tutorial:    It is possible to make your computer continuously boot up into safe mode using the System Configuration utility as described above. The program does this by changing your   file, the settings file that configures your computer's boot sequence, and adding the  argument to your operating systems startup line. An example of this can be seen below.   When you are done using safe mode, you would then run the System Configuration utility again and uncheck the  option, thus removing the /safeboot argument from the boot.ini file, and allowing your computer to boot up normally. On a computer that is operating properly this is normally not a problem. Unfortunately, though, a new trick that some of the more recent malware are using is to delete certain Windows Registry keys so that your computer can not properly boot into safe mode. It is in these situations that using the System Configuration utility to boot into safe mode can cause the computer to become inoperable for many users. This is because once you set the computer to boot into Safe Mode using /Safeboot, it will continuously attempt to start Safe Mode until the /safeboot argument is removed from the boot.ini. Since the malware is not allowing us to actually boot into safe mode, you have no way of getting to a point where you can run the System Configuration utility again to uncheck the   option. Thus, you are stuck with a computer constantly attempting to get into safe mode and not being able to do so. If a situation like this has happened to you it is possible to fix this problem by renaming your boot.ini file. The first step would be to use a   to start your computer. If your computer does not have a floppy disk, then you can typically boot off the Windows CD that came with your computer in order to access the Windows Recovery Console. More information about the Windows Recovery Console can be found  . Once booted to a command prompt, you would simply rename your   file to another name like  . The command to rename the file at the command prompt is: Once the file is renamed, you can then remove the boot disk and reboot your computer to get back to normal mode. When booting up after the rename, do not be surprised if you see an error stating that you do not have a valid Boot.ini file. When you get back to normal Windows mode, you can then rename   to   and run Msconfig again to remove the /safeboot flag.   It is not uncommon when people are helping you troubleshoot your computer that they tell you to enter Safe Mode. With this tutorial you should now know how to enter Safe Mode when it is required. If you have any questions please feel free to post them in our  .

These are those malicious programs that once they infect your machine will start causing havoc on your computer. What many people do not know is that there are many different types of infections that are categorized in the general category of Malware.  - Malware is programming or files that are developed for the purpose of doing harm. Thus, malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, hijackers, and certain type of adware. This article will focus on those malware that are considered viruses, trojans, worms, and viruses, though this information can be used to remove the other types of malware as well. We will not go into specific details about any one particular infection, but rather provide a broad overview of how these infections can be removed. For the most part these instructions should allow you to remove a good deal of infections, but there are some that need special steps to be removed and these won't be covered under this tutorial. Before we continue it is important to understand the generic malware terms that you will be reading about.  - Ransomware are programs that encrypts the files on a computer and then demand a ransom in order to decrypt them. The ransom is typically in a digital currency called Bitcoins. - A program that generates pop-ups on your computer or displays advertisements. It is important to note that not all adware programs are necessarily considered malware. There are many legitimate programs that are given for free that display ads in their programs in order to generate revenue. As long as this information is provided up front then they are generally not considered malware.  - Tech Support Scams are programs that pretend to be an security alert from Microsoft or another company. These fake alerts indicate that something is wrong with your computer and that they locked you out of it until you call a listed phone number. Once you call that number, though, the scammers will try to sell you unnecessary remote support services and software. - A program that allows a remote user to execute commands and tasks on your computer without your permission. These types of programs are typically used to launch attacks on other computers, distribute copyrighted software or media, or hack other computers. - A program that typically dials a premium rate number that has per minute charges over and above the typical call charge. These calls are with the intent of gaining access to pornographic material. - A program that attempts to hijack certain Internet functions like redirecting your start page to the hijacker's own start page, redirecting search queries to a undesired search engine, or replace search results from popular search engines with their own information.  - A program that monitors your activity or information on your computer and sends that information to a remote computer without your knowledge.  - A program that has been designed to appear innocent but has been intentionally designed to cause some malicious activity or to provide a backdoor to your system. - A program that when run, has the ability to self-replicate by infecting other programs and files on your computer. These programs can have many effects ranging from wiping your hard drive, displaying a joke in a small box, or doing nothing at all except to replicate itself. These types of infections tend to be localized to your computer and not have the ability to spread to another computer on their own. The word virus has incorrectly become a general term that encompasses trojans, worms, and viruses.  - A program that when run, has the ability to spread to other computers on its own using either mass-mailing techniques to email addresses found on your computer or by using the Internet to infect a remote computer using known security holes. Just like any program, in order for the program to work, it must be started. Malware programs are no different in this respect and must be started in some fashion in order to do what they were designed to do. For the most part these infections run by creating a configuration entry in the  in order to make these programs start when your computer starts. Unfortunately, though, in the Windows operating system there are many different ways to make a program start which can make it difficult for the average computer user to find manually. Luckily for us, though, there are programs that allow us to cut through this confusion and see the various programs that are automatically starting when windows boots. The program we recommend for this, because its free and detailed, is   from Sysinternals. \nWhen you run this program it will list all the various programs that start when your computer is booted into Windows. For the most part, the majority of these programs are safe and should be left alone unless you know what you are doing or know you do not need them to run at startup. At this point, you should download   and try it out. Just run the Autoruns.exe and look at all the programs that start automatically. Don't uncheck or delete anything at this point. Just examine the information to see an overview of the amount of programs that are starting automatically. When you feel comfortable with what you are seeing, move on to the next section.

At the time, though, we were unable to help as this infection has been incredibly elusive and any supposed samples would not work. Recently, a member known as  , has been able to recover some files that were supposedly encrypted by this malware. Due to our ability to now help users with this infection we have put together a guide that contains all known information about the CryptorBit infection. All of this information has been compiled from reports by victims and consultants who contributed to our over 31 page  . Big thanks to everyone who contributed, especially  ,  ,  ,  , and   for their assistance in working on the repair process. This guide will continue to be updated as new information or approaches are gathered. If you have anything that you think should be added, clarified, or revised please let us know in the support topic linked to below.    is a ransomware program that was released around the beginning of December 2013 that targets all versions of Windows including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. When infected, this ransomware will scan your computer and encrypt any data file it finds regardless of the file type or extension. When it encrypts a file, it will also create a HowDecrypt.txt file and a HowDecrypt.gif in every folder that a file was encrypted. The GIF and TXT files will contain instructions on how to access a payment site that can be used to send in the ransom. This payment site is located on the   network and you can only make the payment in Bitcoins. When CryptorBit modifies your files it is actually not encrypting the entire file, but rather corrupting it by replacing the first 512 bytes of the file. What it appears to be doing is copying the first 512 bytes of the file's original file header, encrypting those bytes, and storing them at the end of the file. It will then create a different 512 byte header and replace the file's normal header with it. This effectively corrupts the file because a program that would normally open this type of file would see an unknown header and not be able to open it. The good news is that a technique has been found that can repair the file's header and thus allow you to recover your corrupted files. As for the registry and file paths this infection is using, not much is known at this time. We have not been able to acquire a working dropper or samples that will run and thus can't give definitive information on what files and registry entries it creates. What we do know is that it will create random files and folders under the %AppData%, %LocalAppData%, or %ProgramData% system folders. It will also create HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce entries to start the infection when Windows starts. Another component that is commonly bundled with CryptorBit is a cryptocoin miner. This component will utilize your computer's CPU to mine digital coins, such as Bitcoin or other coins, for the malware developer that will then be deposited into their wallet. This generates further revenue for the malware developer. Unfortunately, no dropper for this infection has been actively seen in the wild at this time. Victim's reports indicate that their files had become corrupted right after installing a fake Flash update or being infected by a rogue anti-virus program of some sort. At this time, none of these reports have been corroborated. If you find that you are infected with CryptorBit it is suggested that you automatically scan your computer with an antivirus or antimalware program. We have seen that many antivirus vendors are able to detect the infection files and clean them. As these files are widely detected by AV programs, it has been discussed that this infection may actually be installed remotely by someone hacking into a server or computer. This would allow them to disable any AV programs, install the encrypter, encrypt your files, and then clean up the installer. This would also explain why no one has been able to find the installer for this infection. With that said, make sure you change your passwords on your computer and if you use remote desktop, please consider changing your remote desktop port as described in the following tutorial:   The first method is to try and restore your files from a backup. If a backup is unavailable, then you should attempt to restore your files from Shadow Volume Copies. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and higher utilize a feature called Shadow Volume Copies that, if enabled, automatically create backup copies of some your data files for you. For more information on how to restore files via the Shadow Volume Copies, please see this section of the guide: If a backup does not exist and you are unable to restore from the Shadow Volume Copies, then there is still good news! A BleepingComputer.com member named Nathan Scott, aka  , has come up with a program that will allow you to recover JPG, PST, MP3, PDF, .DOC, .XLS, .XLSX, .PPTX, .and DOCX documents that have been encrypted by CryptorBit. To use DecrypterFixer's tools, please use the link below: If you had System Restore enabled on the computer, Windows creates   that contain copies of your files from that point of time when the system restore snapshot was created. These snapshots may allow us to restore a previous version of our files from before they had been encrypted. This method is not fool proof, though, as even though these files may not be encrypted they also may not be the latest version of the file. Please note that Shadow Volume Copies are only available with Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows 7, & Windows 8.  In this section we provide two methods that you can use to restore files and folders from the Shadow Volume Copy. The first method is to use native Windows features and the second method is to use a program called  . It does not hurt to try both and see which methods work better for you. : To restore individual files you can right-click on the file, go into  , and select the   tab. This tab will list all copies of the file that have been stored in a Shadow Volume Copy and the date they were backed up as shown in the image below.     To restore a particular version of the file, simply click on the  button and then select the directory you wish to restore the file to. If you wish to restore the selected file and replace the existing one, click on the   button. If you wish to view the contents of the actual file, you can click on the   button to see the contents of the file before you restore it. This same method can be used to restore an entire folder. Simply right-click on the folder and select   and then the   tabs. You will then be presented with a similar screen as above where you can either   the selected backup of the folder to a new location or   it over the existing folder. : You can also use a program called   to restore entire folders at once. When downloading the program, you can either use the full install download or the portable version as both perform the same functionality. When you start the program you will be shown a screen listing all the drives and the dates that a shadow copy was created. Select the drive (blue arrow) and date (red arrow) that you wish to restore from. This is shown in the image below. To restore a whole folder, right-click on a folder name and select  . You will then be prompted as to where you would like to restore the contents of the folder to. Nathan Scott, aka  , has developed tools that can fix various types of files that have been encrypted by CryptorBit. Currently his tools can recover corrupted PST, JPG, PDF, MP3, DOC, and XLS files. In order to use his tool you must have Microsoft Net Framework 4.0 or higher installed on your computer. If you using Windows XP, you will need to have service pack 3 installed before you can install Net 4.0. If you find that his tools have helped you recover your files, please feel free to send him a tip using one of the methods below: \n : 1BRmwJWpbt6occBRErQ6JBFF1tvbdJ96HJ :  \nTo recover JPEG/JPG, .PDF, .WAV, .PST, .DOC, .XLS, .XLSX, .PPTX, .DOCX, and .MP3 files, you need to download Anti-CryptorBit.exe from the following links.  (ZIP)  Once the file has been downloaded, extract the zip file, and run the Anti-CryptorBit.exe program. This will open the main dashboard for Anti-CryptorBit as shown below.     Simply click on the recovery method that you wish to run and follow the instructions. If you need any help with Anti-CryptorBit please post your questions in the  .   When you are infected with CryptorBit, the infection will create HowDecrypt.txt and HowDecrypt.gif files that contain information on how to pay the ransom. Below is the contents of the HowDecrypt.txt and HowDecrypt.gif messages:   The instructions tell the victim that in order to pay the ransom they need to install a special program called  . Once Tor is installed they can use it to access their hidden web site at the TOR address  . When a user visits that address using the Tor browser they will be shown a page that gives instructions on how to pay Bitcoins in order to receive a CryptorBit decryptor. The current cost for the decryptor as of 02/13/2014 is .6 BTC. \n \n In order to submit the payment you will need to first enter the Personal Code from your HowDecrypt.txt files. The site will report back how many bitcoins you need to send as your ransom payment. Once you send the bitcoins to the requested address and fill in the rest of the information, you will supposedly be sent a CryptorBit Decryptor program. I have no first-hand knowledge of anyone paying the ransom and have not seen the decryptor. Based on the payments sent to known  , though, quite a few people appear to have paid the ransom.   CryptorBit allows you to pay the ransom by sending bitcoins to an address shown in the CryptorBit Decryptor Purchase page. Bitcoins are currently worth over $600 USD on some bitcoins exchanges. CryptorBit has used different bitcoin payment addresses for those who were infected. Some of these addresses are below: You can use the links above to see transactions into the wallet and out of the wallet. You can typically tell which payments to this address are from ransom victims as there will be many payments with the same amount.   You can use the Windows Group or Local Policy Editor to create Software Restriction Policies that block executables from running when they are located in specific paths. For more information on how to configure Software Restriction Policies, please see these articles from MS: The file paths that have been used by this infection and its droppers are: C:\\<random>\\<random>.exe \nC:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Local Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) \n%Temp%  In order to block the CryptorBit you want to create Path Rules so that they are not allowed to execute. To create these Software Restriction Policies, you can either use the   tool or add the policies   using the Local Security Policy Editor or the Group Policy Editor. Both methods are described below. If you are using Windows Home or Windows Home Premium, the Local Security Policy Editor will not be available to you. Instead we suggest you use the   tool, which will automatically set these policies for you.  was kind enough to create a free utility called CryptoPrevent that automatically adds the suggested Software Restriction Policy Path Rules listed above to your computer. This makes it very easy for anyone using Windows XP SP 2 and above to quickly add the Software Restriction Policies to your computer in order to prevent CryptorBit and Zbot from being executed in the first place. This tool is also able to set these policies in all versions of Windows, including the Home versions. A new feature of CryptoPrevent is the option to whitelist any existing programs in %AppData% or %LocalAppData%. This is a useful feature as it will make sure the restrictions that are put in place do not affect legitimate applications that are already installed on your computer. To use this feature make sure you check the option labeled   before you press the   button. You can download CryptoPrevent from the following page: For more information on how to use the tool, please see this page: You can use CryptoPrevent for free, but if you wish to   the premium version you can use the coupon code   to get 30% off. The premium version includes automatic and silent updating of application and definitions on a regular schedule, email alerts when an application blocked, and custom allow and block policies to fine-tune your protection. Note: In full disclosure, BleepingComputer earns a commission for the sales of CryptoPrevent. Once you run the program, simply click on the   button to add the default Software Restriction Policies to your computer. If you wish to customize the settings, then please review the checkboxes and change them as necessary. If CryptoPrevent causes issues running legitimate applications, then please see   on how to enable specific applications. You can also remove the Software Restriction Policies that were added by clicking on the   button.  In order to manually create the Software Restriction Policies you need to be using Windows Professional or Windows Server. If you want to set these policies for a particular computer you can use the Local Security Policy Editor. If you wish to set these policies for the entire domain, then you need to use the Group Policy Editor. Unfortunately, if you are a Windows Home user, the Local Policy Editor ir not available and you should use the   tool instead to set these policies. To open the Local Security Policy editor, click on the   button and type   and select the search result that appears. You can open the Group Policy Editor by typing   instead. In this guide we will use the Local Security Policy Editor in our examples.  Once you open the Local Security Policy Editor, you will see a screen similar to the one below. Once the above screen is open, expand   and then click on the   section. If you do not see the items in the right pane as shown above, you will need to add a new policy. To do this click on the   button and select  . This will then enable the policy and the right pane will appear as in the image above. You should then click on the   category and then right-click in the right pane and select  . You should then add a Path Rule for each of the items listed below. If the Software Restriction Policies cause issues when trying to run legitimate applications, you should see   on how to enable specific applications. Below are a few Path Rules that are suggested you use to not only block the infections from running, but also to block attachments from being executed when opened in an e-mail client.    . .     You can see an event log entry and alert showing an executable being blocked:   If you need help configuring this, feel free to ask in the  .   If you use Software Restriction Policies, or CryptoPrevent, to block CryptorBit you may find that some legitimate applications no longer run. This is because some companies mistakenly install their applications under a user's profile rather than in the Program Files folder where they belong. Due to this, the Software Restriction Policies will prevent those applications from running.  Thankfully, when Microsoft designed Software Restriction Policies they made it so a Path Rule that specifies a program is allowed to run overrides any path rules that may block it. Therefore, if a Software Restriction Policy is blocking a legitimate program, you will need to use the   given above to add a Path Rule that allows the program to run. To do this you will need to create a Path Rule for a particular program's executable and set the Security Level to   instead of Disallowed as shown in the image below.     Once you add these Unrestricted Path Rules, the specified applications will be allowed to run again.

This ransomware infection will affect all versions of Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. When a victim is infected they will have their files encrypted and then a ransom of about .5 bitcoins will be demanded in order to receive the decryption key. When Locky infects your computer it will scan all the drive letters and network shares for targeted file types and encrypt them using the AES encryption algorithm. Once these files are encrypted, they will no longer able to be opened by your normal programs. When Locky has finished encrypting the victim's files, it will change the desktop wallpaper to an image that acts like a ransom note. It will also display a HTML ransom note in your default browser. These ransom notes include instructions on how to connect to the   where you can learn more about what happened to your files and how you can make a Locky ransom payment. At today's current bitcoin rates, the ransom of .5 bitcoins is approximately $230 USD. The bitcoin address that you must submit payment to will be different for every victim. When Locky is first installed it will check to see if the computer is using the Russian language, and if it is, will not encrypt the computer. Otherwise, it will connect to a remote Command & Control server that is under the Locky developer's control and send it the ID associated with the victim's infection. This ID is generated by taking the first 16 characters of a MD5 hash of the GUID for the storage volume that Windows is installed on. Once it sends the ID, Locky will respond with an RSA key that will be used during the encryption process. Locky will then create a Windows registry key that it will use to store configuration information. This registry key is located at  . Locky will now scan the computer's local, removable, mapped drives, and unmapped network shares for file types that it targets for encryption. The extensions targeted by Locky are: When a file is encrypted it will generate a new   key and encrypt the file with it. This AES encryption key is then further encrypted by the RSA key that was retrieved from the Command & Control server. This RSA encrypted AES key will then be stored in the encrypted file. When a file is encrypted it will be renamed to different formats depending on the version of Locky. Many of these extensions are named after gods from Norse and Egyption mythology. The current extension used by encrypted files is  .  Below is a list of extensions Locky has used for encrypted files: It important to stress that Locky will scan all drive letters on your computer including removable drives, network shares, and even DropBox mappings. In summary, if there is a drive letter on your computer it will be scanned for data files to encrypt by the ransomware When the infection has finished scanning your computer it will attempt to delete all of the Shadow Volume Copies that are on the affected computer. It does this so that you cannot use the shadow volume copies to restore your encrypted files. In my tests, this process sometimes fails so you may be able to use the   to recover your files. The command that is run to clear the Shadow Volumes is: Now that your computer's data has been encrypted it will display the   ransom note, which is displayed below. An example text of the ransom note is: ﻿*+_+~~-+~=~*$$-   All of your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 and AES-128 ciphers. \nMore information about the RSA and AES can be found here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem) \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard \nDecrypting of your files is only possible with the private key and decrypt program, which is on our secret server. \nTo receive your private key follow one of the links: \n1. http://25z5g623wpqpdwis.tor2web.org/F61242A1A24B711E \n2. http://25z5g623wpqpdwis.onion.to/F61242A1A24B711E \n3. http://25z5g623wpqpdwis.onion.cab/F61242A1A24B711E If all of this addresses are not available, follow these steps: \n1. Download and install Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html \n2. After a successful installation, run the browser and wait for initialization. \n3. Type in the address bar: 25z5g623wpqpdwis.onion/F61242A1A24B711E \n4. Follow the instructions on the site. !!! Your personal identification ID: F61242A1A24B711E !!! +$.+~-=*-.*.~. \n=|++~--~=$_-|_ \n_=$.._  Both of these ransom notes will contain your unique ID and URLs to a   site where you can learn how much your ransom is and how to make the ransom payment. The payment site for Locky is called the Locky Decryptor Page. For more details about the the payment site, please skip to  . If you discover that your computer is infected with Locky you should immediately shutdown your computer and if possible create a copy, or image, of your hard drive. This allows you to save the complete state of your hard drive in the event that a free decryption method is developed in the future. For more information on how to do this, feel free to ask in the  . If you do not plan on paying the ransom and can restore from a backup, then scan your computer with an anti-virus or anti-malware program and let it remove everything. Unfortunately, most people do not realize Locky is on their computer until it displays the ransom note and your files have already been encrypted. The scans, though, will at least detect and remove any other malware that may have been installed along with the ransomware program. As always we never recommend you pay the ransom, but if you do plan on doing so, it is important that you do not delete the ransom notes as you will need your ID to make payment.  A user is typically infected by Locky through emails that pretend to be invoices or via exploit kits on hacked sites. These invoices will have a subject similar to   or  and have an attached malicious word document or zip file containing a javascript installer. These attachments will have file names like  or  .  When you double-click on the word document and enable macros or execute the javascript file, it will download the Locky ransomware executable and begin the encryption process.  Locky can also infect your computer when you visit a hacked site that has an exploit kit on it. These exploit kits will scan your computer for vulnerable programs and attempt to exploit them to install and start the ransomware without your knowledge. Therefore, it is imperative that everyone keeps Windows and their installed programs up-to-date. You can use these tutorials for more information on keeping your Windows installation and installed programs updated:   Locky has the ability to encrypt files on network shares even if they are unmapped. Therefore, it is important that all system administrators tighten the permissions on their network shares and only give access as necessary. It is still strongly suggested that you secure all open shares by only allowing writable access to the necessary user groups or authenticated users. This is an important security principle that should be used at all times regardless of infections like these. For many system administrators, finding the infected computer that encrypted a network share can be a frustrating experience. When trying to figure this out, I always recommend that you check the properties of an encrypted file and check who the owner of the file is. You can use this owner to then pinpoint the infected machine. The developers of Locky created a TOR payment site called the  . This site can be used by victims to pay the ransom and download a decryptor. When you visit this site you will receive information about your encrypted files and learn how to pay the ransom. Links to this site can be found in the ransom notes created on your Windows desktop and other locations on your computer. Once you visit the site you can pay the ransom, which is currently around $230 USD, by sending Bitcoins to the specified address.    \n \n \n   Once a payment is made, the web site will wait for a certain amount of bitcoin   before your private key will be made available to you. Once there have been enough confirmations, the decryptor will be made available to you for download. Please note that each victim has their own unique decryptor that will not work with any other infected computer. Therefore, the decryptor for one victim will NOT work on another victim's computer. First and foremost, only pay the ransom if you have absolutely no choice. By paying the ransom you just encourage the malware developers to continue making ransomware infections like Locky. With that said, if you have no choice, then the ransomware developers will provide the decryption program if you pay the ransom. They know that if they do not deliver on their promises after making a payment, word will get out and no one else will pay.  Once you pay the ransom and it is verified, a download link will appear on your Locky Decryptor Page that will allow you to download a decryptor. Please note that the decryption process can take quite a bit of time. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible decrypt Locky encrypted files for free. It may, though, be possible in the future if the decryption keys are recovered from the Locky Command & Control servers. Therefore, if you do not plan on paying the ransom, it is advised that you make an image of the encrypted drives so that you can possibly decrypt them in the future. Your only way to recover Locky encrypted files is to try and restore them from a backup, from file recovery software, or if you are lucky, the Shadow Volume Copies. I have outlined different methods below that you can use to attempt to recover your files. The first and best method is to restore your data from a recent backup. If you have been performing backups, then you should use your backups to restore your data. Surprisingly, on a recent test Locky did not properly wipe the Shadow Volume Copies. So I suggest that everyone try recovering their files using Shadow Volumes in the event that they were not deleted correctly. For more information on how to restore your files via Shadow Volume Copies, please see the link below: When Locky encrypts a file it first makes a copy of it, encrypts the copy, and then deletes the original. Due to this you may be able to use file recovery software such as   or   to possibly recover some of your original files. It is important to note that the more you use your computer after the files are encrypted the more difficult it will be for file recovery programs to recover the deleted un-encrypted files. If you had your dropbox account mapped as a drive letter then it is possible that its contents were encrypted by Locky. If this is the case you can use the link below to learn how to restore your files. If you had System Restore enabled on the computer, Windows creates   that contain copies of your files from that point of time when the system restore snapshot was created. These snapshots may allow us to restore a previous version of our files from before they had been encrypted. This method is not fool proof, though, as even though these files may not be encrypted they also may not be the latest version of the file. Please note that Shadow Volume Copies are only available with Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows 7, & Windows 8. Locky will attempt to delete all shadow copies when you first start any executable on your computer after becoming infected. Thankfully, the infection is not always able to remove the shadow copies, so there is a small chance you may be able to restore your files using this method.  In this section we provide two methods that you can use to restore files and folders from the Shadow Volume Copy. The first method is to use native Windows features and the second method is to use a program called  . It does not hurt to try both and see which methods work better for you. : To restore individual files you can right-click on the file, go into  , and select the   tab.

Simply right-click on the folder and select   and then the   tabs. You will then be presented with a similar screen as above where you can either   the selected backup of the folder to a new location or   it over the existing folder. : You can also use a program called   to restore entire folders at once. When downloading the program, you can either use the full install download or the portable version as both perform the same functionality. When you start the program you will be shown a screen listing all the drives and the dates that a shadow copy was created. Select the drive (blue arrow) and date (red arrow) that you wish to restore from. This is shown in the image below. To restore a whole folder, right-click on a folder name and select  . You will then be prompted as to where you would like to restore the contents of the folder to. If you have DropBox mapped to a drive letter on an infected computer or synchronized to a folder, Locky will attempt to encrypt the files on it. DropBox offers free versioning on all of its accounts that will allow you to restore encrypted files through their website. Unfortunately, the restoral process offered by DropBox only allows you to restore one file at a time rather than a whole folder. If you need instructions on restoring an entire folder in DropBox, please click  .  To restore a file, simply login to the DropBox web site and navigate to the folder that contains the encrypted files you wish to restore. Once you are in the folder, right-click on the encrypted file and select Previous Versions as shown in the image below.     When you click on Previous versions you will be presented with a screen that shows all versions of the encrypted file.     Select the version of the file you wish to restore and click on the   button to restore that file. Unfortunately the process outlined above can be very time consuming if there are many folder to restore. In order to restore an entire folder of encrypted files, you can use the dropbox-restore python script located  . Please note that this script requires Python to be installed on the encrypted computer to execute the script. Instructions on how to use this script can be found in the   file for this project. There are a few methods and utilities that we recommend in order to protect your computer from ransomware infections. Three of the methods are the Emsisoft Anti-Malware, HitmanPro: Alert, and the Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware and HitmanPro: Alert programs. The fourth option is to utilize Software Restriction Policies that prevent programs from being allowed to execute from certain locations. In full disclosure, BleepingComputer.com makes a commission off of the sales of Emsisoft Anti-Malware, HitmanPro: Alert, and CryptoPrevent, but does not from Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware. Emsisoft Anti-Malware, or EAM, has a feature called behavior blocker that has a proven track record of blocking ransomware before it can start encrypting data on your computer. Unlike traditional antivirus definitions, EAM's behavior blocker examines the behavior of a process and if this behavior contains certain characteristics commonly found in malware it will prevent it from running. Using the detection method, behavior blocker detects when a process is scanning a computer for files and then attempting to encrypt them. If it discovers this behavior, it will automatically terminate the process. According to an   at Emsisoft's site, EAM's behavior blocker was able to block 20 crypto-ransomware families without the use of signatures. You can find more information about Emsisoft Anti-Malware and behavior blocker here:  HitmanPro: Alert is a great program as well but is designed as a full featured anti-exploit program and is not targeted exclusively at ransomware infections. Alert provides protection from computer vulnerabilities and malware that attempts to steal your data. Unfortunately, because this program has a much broader focus it sometimes needs to be updated as new ransomware is released. As long as you stay on top of the updates, HitmanPro: Alert offers excellent protection.  You can find more information about HitmanPro: Alert here:  Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware is another program that does not rely on signatures or heuristics, but rather by detecting behavior that is consistent with what is seen in ransomware infections. At this point, Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware is currently in beta, so be careful about using this on a production environment until the kinks are worked out.  You can download and get more information information about Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware here:  A very secure method of preventing a ransomware, or almost any other malware, infection is to use a method called  . Application whitelisting is when you lock down Windows so that all executables are denied except for those that you specifically allow to run. Since you are only allowing programs you trust to run, if you are infected the malware executable would not be able to run and thus could not infect you. For those who are interested in learning more about application whitelisting, you can view this tutorial:  . You can use the Windows Group or Local Policy Editor to create Software Restriction Policies that block executables from running when they are located in specific file locations. For more information on how to configure Software Restriction Policies, please see these articles from MS: The file paths that have been used by this infection and its droppers are:  C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Local Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) \n%Temp% \nC:\\Windows\n In order to block Locky, and other ransomware, you want to create Path Rules so that they are not allowed to execute. To create these Software Restriction Policies, you can either use the   tool or add the policies   using the Local Security Policy Editor or the Group Policy Editor. Both methods are described below. If you are using Windows Home or Windows Home Premium, the Local Security Policy Editor will not be available to you. Instead we suggest you use the   tool, which will automatically set these policies for you.  was kind enough to create a free utility called CryptoPrevent that automatically adds the suggested Software Restriction Policy Path Rules listed above to your computer. This makes it very easy for anyone using Windows XP SP 2 and above to quickly add the Software Restriction Policies to your computer in order to prevent Locky, and other ransomware, from being executed in the first place. This tool is also able to set these policies in all versions of Windows, including the Home versions. A new feature of CryptoPrevent is the option to whitelist any existing programs in %AppData% or %LocalAppData%. This is a useful feature as it will make sure the restrictions that are put in place do not affect legitimate applications that are already installed on your computer. To use this feature make sure you check the option labeled   before you press the   button. You can use CryptoPrevent for free, but if you wish to   the premium version you can use the coupon code   to get 30% off. The premium version includes automatic and silent updating of application and definitions on a regular schedule, email alerts when an application blocked, and custom allow and block policies to fine-tune your protection. You can download CryptoPrevent from the following page: For more information on how to use the tool, please see this page: Once you run the program, simply click on the   button to add the default Software Restriction Policies to your computer. If you wish to customize the settings, then please review the checkboxes and change them as necessary. If CryptoPrevent causes issues running legitimate applications, then please see   on how to enable specific applications. You can also remove the Software Restriction Policies that were added by clicking on the   button.  In order to manually create the Software Restriction Policies you need to be using Windows Professional or Windows Server. If you want to set these policies for a particular computer you can use the Local Security Policy Editor. If you wish to set these policies for the entire domain, then you need to use the Group Policy Editor. Unfortunately, if you are a Windows Home user, the Local Policy Editor is not available and you should use the   tool instead to set these policies. To open the Local Security Policy editor, click on the   button and type   and select the search result that appears. You can open the Group Policy Editor by typing   instead. In this guide we will use the Local Security Policy Editor in our examples.  Once you open the Local Security Policy Editor, you will see a screen similar to the one below. Once the above screen is open, expand   and then click on the   section. If you do not see the items in the right pane as shown above, you will need to add a new policy. To do this click on the   button and select  . This will then enable the policy and the right pane will appear as in the image above. You should then click on the   category and then right-click in the right pane and select  . You should then add a Path Rule for each of the items listed below. If the Software Restriction Policies cause issues when trying to run legitimate applications, you should see   on how to enable specific applications. Below are a few Path Rules that are suggested you use to not only block the infections from running, but also to block attachments from being executed when opened in an e-mail client.    . .     You can see an event log entry and alert showing an executable being blocked:   If you need help configuring this, feel free to ask in the  If you use Software Restriction Policies, or CryptoPrevent, to block Locky you may find that some legitimate applications no longer run. This is because some companies mistakenly install their applications under a user's profile rather than in the Program Files folder where they belong. Due to this, the Software Restriction Policies will prevent those applications from running.  Thankfully, when Microsoft designed Software Restriction Policies they made it so a Path Rule that specifies a program is allowed to run overrides any path rules that may block it. Therefore, if a Software Restriction Policy is blocking a legitimate program, you will need to use the   given above to add a Path Rule that allows the program to run. To do this you will need to create a Path Rule for a particular program's executable and set the Security Level to   instead of Disallowed as shown in the image below.     Once you add these Unrestricted Path Rules, the specified applications will be allowed to run again. %UserpProfile%\\Desktop\\_HELP_instructions.bmp\n%UserpProfile%\\Desktop\\_HELP_instructions.html\n%UserpProfile%\\Desktop\\_Locky_recover_instructions.bmp\n%UserpProfile%\\Desktop\\_Locky_recover_instructions.txt\n%Temp%\\[random].exe\n  refers to the Windows Temp folder.

As BleepingComputer.com was one of the first support sites to try helping users who are infected with this infection, I thought it would be better to post all the known information about this infection in one place. This FAQ will give you all the information you need to understand the infection and restore your files via the decrypter or other methods. In many ways this guide feels like a support topic on how to pay the ransom, which sickens me. Unfortunately, this infection is devious and many people have no choice but to pay the ransom in order to get their files back. I apologize in advance if this is seen as helping the developers, when in fact my goal is to help the infected users with whatever they decide to do.  All of this information has been compiled from my own experimentation with this infection, from Fabian Wosar of   who first analyzed this infection, and through all the consultants and visitors who contributed to our 207 page  . Big thanks to everyone who contributed information about this infection. This guide will continue to be updated as new information or approaches are gathered. If you have anything that you think should be added, clarified, or revised please let us know in the support topic linked to above.  is a ransomware program that was released in the beginning of September 2013 that targets all versions of Windows including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This ransomware will encrypt certain files using a mixture of RSA & AES encryption. When it has finished encrypting your files, it will display a CryptoLocker payment program that prompts you to send a ransom of either $100 or $300 in order to decrypt the files. This screen will also display a timer stating that you have 72 hours, or 4 days, to pay the ransom or it will delete your encryption key and you will not have any way to decrypt your files. This ransom must be paid using MoneyPak vouchers or Bitcoins. Once you send the payment and it is verified, the program will decrypt the files that it encrypted. When you first become infected with CryptoLocker, it will save itself as a random named filename to the root of the %AppData% or %LocalAppData% path. It will then create one of the following autostart entries in the registry to start CryptoLocker when you login: KEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"CryptoLocker\" \nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce \"*CryptoLocker\" \nKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run \"CryptoLocker_<version_number>\" \nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce \"*CryptoLocker_<version_number\" Please note that the * in front of the RunOnce value causes CryptoLocker to start in Safe Mode. The infection will also hijack your .EXE extensions so that when you launch an executable it will attempt to delete the Shadow Volume Copies that are on the affected computer. It does this because you can use shadow volume copies to restore your encrypted files. The command that is run when you click on an executable is: The .EXE hijack in the Registry will look similar to the following. Please note that registry key names will be random. [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.exe] \n@=\"Myjiaabodehhltdr\" \n\"Content Type\"=\"application/x-msdownload\" [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.exe\\PersistentHandler] \n@=\"{098f2470-bae0-11cd-b579-08002b30bfeb}\" [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Myjiaabodehhltdr] [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Myjiaabodehhltdr\\DefaultIcon] \n@=\"%1\" [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Myjiaabodehhltdr\\shell] [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Myjiaabodehhltdr\\shell\\open] [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Myjiaabodehhltdr\\shell\\open\\command] \n@=\"\\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Rlatviomorjzlefba.exe\\\" - \\\"%1\\\" %*\" Once the infection has successfully deleted your shadow volume copies, it will restore your exe extensions back to the Windows defaults. The infection will then attempt to find a live Command & Control server by connecting to domains generated by a  . Some examples of domain names that the DGA will generate are lcxgidtthdjje.org, kdavymybmdrew.biz, dhlfdoukwrhjc.co.uk, and xodeaxjmnxvpv.ru. Once a live C&C server is discovered it will communicate with it and receive a public encryption key that will be used to encrypt your data files. It will then store this key along with other information in values under the registry key under  .\nUnfortunately, the private key that is used to decrypt the infected files is not saved on the computer but rather the Command & Control server.\n CryptoLocker will then begin to scan all physical or mapped network drives on your computer for files with the following extensions: *.odt, *.ods, *.odp, *.odm, *.odc, *.odb, *.doc, *.docx, *.docm, *.wps, *.xls, *.xlsx, *.xlsm, *.xlsb, *.xlk, *.ppt, *.pptx, *.pptm, *.mdb, *.accdb, *.pst, *.dwg, *.dxf, *.dxg, *.wpd, *.rtf, *.wb2, *.mdf, *.dbf, *.psd, *.pdd, *.pdf, *.eps, *.ai, *.indd, *.cdr, *.jpg, *.jpe, *.jpg, *.dng, *.3fr, *.arw, *.srf, *.sr2, *.bay, *.crw, *.cr2, *.dcr, *.kdc, *.erf, *.mef, *.mrw, *.nef, *.nrw, *.orf, *.raf, *.raw, *.rwl, *.rw2, *.r3d, *.ptx, *.pef, *.srw, *.x3f, *.der, *.cer, *.crt, *.pem, *.pfx, *.p12, *.p7b, *.p7c. When it finds files that match one of these types, it will encrypt the file using the public encryption key and add the full path to the file and the filename as a value under the   Registry key. When it has finished encrypting your data files it will then show the CryptoLocker screen as shown above and demand a ransom of either $100 or $300 dollars in order to decrypt your files. This ransom must be paid using Bitcoin or MoneyPak vouchers. It also states that you must pay this ransom within 96 hours or the private encryption key will be destroyed on the developer's servers. Warning: If you enter an incorrect payment code, it will decrease the amount of time you have available to decrypt your files. So if you plan on paying the ransom, please be careful as you type the code. More technical details about this infection can be at this   by Emsisoft. This section lists all known file paths and registry keys used by CryptoLocker. The file paths and registry keys that are currently being used by CryptoLocker will be highlighted in  The File paths that are currently and historically being used by CryptoLocker are: and  Examples of filenames using this path are:   and  . In Windows XP, %AppData% corresponds to C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Login Name>\\Application Data. \nIn Windows Vista, 7, and 8, %AppData% corresponds to C:\\Users\\<Login Name>\\AppData\\Roaming. Examples of filenames using this path are:  .  In Windows XP, %LocalAppData% corresponds to C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Login Name>\\Local Settings\\Application Data\\. \nIn Windows Vista, 7, and 8, %LocalAppData% corresponds to C:\\Users\\<Login Name>\\AppData\\Local. The Registry key that is used to automatically start CryptoLocker when you login to Windows are found below.  For the above registry values, the current version is  . Please note that the   in the RunOnce entry tells Windows to start CryptoLocker even in Windows Safe Mode. CryptoLocker also creates a registry key to store its configuration information and the files that were encrypted. In the past the registry key that was used was HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\CryptoLocker. Newer version now include the version of the malware, which is currently 0388, in the key name.  The registry key that is currently being used to store the configuration information is\n . Under this key are 3 registry values that are described below: Under the   key will be a list of all the files that have been encrypted by CryptoLocker. This list is then processed by the decryption tool to decrypt your files if you paid the ransom. For each file that is encrypted, a new REG_DWORD value will be created that is named using the full pathname to the encrypted file. When naming the values, CryptoLocker will replace all occurrences of the forward slash character ( ), with a question mark. An example of how an encrypted file's value entry would be named is  . You can use the   program to export a human readable list of these encrypted files from the registry into a text file. Since the release of   it is possible to decrypt files without this registry key being available. The new decrypter provided by this service will instead scan your files and attempt to decrypt them using the embedded private decryption key.   When you discover that a computer is infected with CryptoLocker, the first thing you should do is disconnect it from your wireless or wired network. This will prevent it from further encrypting any files. Some people have reported that once the network connection is disconnected, it will display the CryptoLocker screen. It is not advised that you remove the infection from the %AppData% folder until you decide if you want to pay the ransom. If you do not need to pay the ransom, simply delete the Registry values and files and the program will not load anymore. You can then restore your data via other methods. It is important to note that the CryptoLocker infection spawns two processes of itself. If you only terminate one process, the other process will automatically launch the second one again. Instead use a program like   and right click on the first process and select  . This will terminate both at the same time. :  and   have released a method of possibly retrieving your private decryption key and a decrypter to use to decrypt your files. These keys were made available through   and were not retrieved by cracking the encryption. To try and retrieve your key, please visit their site   and enter your email and upload a copy of one of your CryptoLocker encrypted files. The service will then try attempt to decrypt that file using all of the known encryption keys. If they are able to successfully decrypt your file, they will then email you the decryption key with instructions on how to use it.  In order to use the decryption you need to paste the entire decryption key they send you, quotes and all, after the --key argument of the Decryptolocker.exe program. An example of how you would decrypt all of the folders and files under a particular folder can be found in this  . As the instructions and how to use the tool are not particularly user-friendly, if you need any help, please see feel free to ask in the  . It should also be noted that you can use a different script, that it appears the FireEye/Fox-IT one was based off of, as well. Instructions on using the alternative decrypter can be found  . If your key is not available using the above methods, the only methods you have of restoring your files is from a backup or Shadow Volume Copies if you have System Restore enabled. Newer variants of CryptoLocker attempt to delete the Shadow Copies, but it is not always successful. More information about how to restore your files via Shadow Volume Copies can be found in   below. If you do not have System Restore enabled on your computer or reliable backups, then you will need to pay the ransom in order to get your files back.  Paying the ransom will start the decryption process of the CryptoLocker infection. When you pay the ransom you will be shown a screen stating that your payment is being verified. Reports from people who have paid this ransom state that this verification process can take 3-4 hours to complete. Once the payment has been verified, the infection will start decrypting your files. Once again, it has been reported that the decryption process can take quite a bit of time. Be warned, that there have been some reports that the decryption process may give an error stating that it can't decrypt a particular file. At this point we have no information as how to resolve this. Visitors have reported that the infection will continue to decrypt the rest of the files even if it has a problem with certain files. This infection is typically spread through emails sent to company email addresses that pretend to be customer support related issues from Fedex, UPS, DHS, etc. These emails would contain a zip attachment that when opened would infect the computer. These zip files contain executables that are disguised as PDF files as they have a PDF icon and are typically named something like FORM_101513.exe or FORM_101513.pdf.exe. Since Microsoft does not show extensions by default, they look like normal PDF files and people open them. When CryptoLocker was first released, it was being distributed by itself. Newer malware attachments appear to be Zbot infections that then install the CryptoLocker infection. You will know you are infected with Zbot as there will be a registry key in the form of: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\<random> Under these keys you will see Value names with data that appears to be garbage data (encrypted info). The droppers will also be found in the %Temp% folder and the main executable will be stored in a random folder under  . Last but not least, a startup will be created under   to launch it. An example Zbot/CryptoLocker email message is: -----Original Message----- \nFrom: John Doe [mailto:John@mydomain.com] \nSent: Tuesday, October 15, 2013 10:34 AM \nTo: Jane Doe \nSubject: Annual Form - Authorization to Use Privately Owned Vehicle on State Business All employees need to have on file this form STD 261 (attached). The original is retained by supervisor and copy goes to Accounting. Accounting need this form to approve mileage reimbursement. The form can be used for multiple years, however it needs to re-signed annually by employee and supervisor. Please confirm all employees that may travel using their private car on state business (including training) has a current STD 261 on file. Not having a current copy of this form on file in Accounting may delay a travel reimbursement claim. The current list of known CryptoLocker email subjects include: CryptoLocker allows you to pay the ransom by sending 2 bitcoins to an address shown in the decryption program. Bitcoins are currently worth over $200 USD on some bitcoins exchanges. Earlier variants of CryptoLocker included static bitcoin addresses for everyone who was infected. These static addresses include: Newer variants of CryptoLocker dynamically generate new bitcoin payment addresses for each instance of an infection. You can use the links above to see transactions into the wallet and out of the wallet. CryptoLocker only encrypts data stored on network shares if the shared folders are mapped as a drive letter on the infected computer. Despite what some articles state, CryptoLocker   encrypt data on a network through UNC shares. An example of a UNC share is \\\\computername\\openshare. It is strongly suggested that you secure all open shares by only allowing writable access to the necessary user groups or authenticated users. This is an important security principle that should be used at all times regardless of infections like CryptoLocker. As many anti-virus programs would delete the CryptoLocker executables after the encryption started, you would be left with encrypted files and no way to decrypt them. Recent versions of CryptoLocker will now set your Windows wallpaper to a message that contains a link to a decryption tool that you can download in case this happens. There are numerous reports that this download will not double-encrypt your files and will allow you to decrypt encrypted files. When the CryptoLocker is first shown, you will see a timer that states you need to pay the ransom within 96 hours. Some people have reported that you can increase the time by rolling back the clock in your BIOS. So to increase the timer by 10 hours, you would change your clock in your BIOS to 10 hours earlier. The virus author has   that using this method will not help. They have said that the private key required for decryption will be deleted from the Command & Control server after the allotted time regardless of how much time it says is left on the infected computer. Tests by users, though, have shown that the private keys are not deleted and you can pay the ransom even if your time has run out. The steps that people have reported to work are: It is unknown if this method will still work now that the   was created. People have asked how they can contact the author of this infection when their payment does not go through. There is no direct way to contact the developer of this computer infection. They are, though, monitoring the various threads about this infection, including our  , and have responded to infected user's issues as well as to give other messages on the home page of their Command & Control servers. The address for this Command & Control server can be found on the desktop wallpaper on an infected computer. The url that they specify to download the decrypter, can also be used to view the messages from the author. Simply go to the home page rather than the executable. So if the wallpaper has an URL of http://kjasdklhjlas.info/1002.exe, to see the message you would go to http://kjasdklhjlas.info/. Please note that this url is not valid. As of 11/01/13, the Command & Control server home page was changed to the CryptoLocker Decryption Service. This decryption service can also be accessed via TOR at the address f2d2v7soksbskekh.onion/. This service allows you to upload an encrypted file that performs a search for your public key. When your public is found if you had previously paid the ransom, it will give you a link to your private key and decrypter. If you had not paid the ransom already then you will be given the option to purchase the private key and a decrypter. The cost of the private key remains 2 bitcoins if you within the standard 72 hour time frame, but if that has expired the price jumps to 10 bitcoins. At 10 bitcoins the ransom payment is over $2,290 USD.  \n \n \n Once a payment is made it must have 10-15 bitcoin   before your private key and a decrypter will be made available for download. Once these confirmations have occurred a download link will be displayed that will allow you to download a standalone decrypter. This decrypter will already have your private decryption key stored in the program and can be used to scan for and decrypt encrypted files. \n \n \n \n More information about this decryption service can be found in this news article:  . If you had System Restore enabled on the computer, Windows creates   that contain copies of your files from that point of time when the system restore snapshot was created. These snapshots may allow us to restore a previous version of our files from before they had been encrypted. This method is not fool proof, though, as even though these files may not be encrypted they also may not be the latest version of the file. Please note that Shadow Volume Copies are only available with Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows 7, & Windows 8. Newer variants of CryptoLocker will attempt to delete all shadow copies when you first start any executable on your computer after becoming infected. Thankfully, the infection is not always able to remove the shadow copies, so you should continue to try restoring your files using this method.  In this section we provide two methods that you can use to restore files and folders from the Shadow Volume Copy. The first method is to use native Windows features and the second method is to use a program called  . It does not hurt to try both and see which methods work better for you. To restore individual files you can right-click on the file, go into  , and select the   tab. This tab will list all copies of the file that have been stored in a Shadow Volume Copy and the date they were backed up as shown in the image below. To restore a particular version of the file, simply click on the  button and then select the directory you wish to restore the file to. If you wish to restore the selected file and replace the existing one, click on the   button. If you wish to view the contents of the actual file, you can click on the   button to see the contents of the file before you restore it. This same method can be used to restore an entire folder. Simply right-click on the folder and select   and then the   tabs. You will then be presented with a similar screen as above where you can either   the selected backup of the folder to a new location or   it over the existing folder. You can also use a program called   to restore entire folders at once. When downloading the program, you can either use the full install download or the portable version as both perform the same functionality. When you start the program you will be shown a screen listing all the drives and the dates that a shadow copy was created. Select the drive (blue arrow) and date (red arrow) that you wish to restore from. This is shown in the image below. To restore a whole folder, right-click on a folder name and select  . You will then be prompted as to where you would like to restore the contents of the folder to. If you have DropBox mapped to a drive letter on an infected computer, CryptoLocker will attempt to encrypt the files on the drive. DropBox offers free versioning on all of its accounts that will allow you to restore encrypted files through their website. Unfortunately, the restoral process offered by DropBox only allows you to restore one file at a time rather than a whole folder. If you need instructions on restoring an entire folder in DropBox, please click  .  To restore a file, simply login to the DropBox web site and navigate to the folder that contains the encrypted files you wish to restore. Once you are in the folder, right-click on the encrypted file and select Previous Versions as shown in the image below. When you click on Previous versions you will be presented with a screen that shows all versions of the encrypted file. Select the version of the file you wish to restore and click on the   button to restore that file. Unfortunately the process outlined above can be very time consuming if there are many folder to restore. In order to restore an entire folder of encrypted files, you can use the dropbox-restore python script located  . Please note that this script requires Python to be installed on the encrypted computer to execute the script. Instructions on how to use this script can be found in the   file for this project. There are currently three method that you can use to generate a list of files that have been possible encrypted. Each of these methods is outlined below. If you wish to generate a list of files that have been encrypted, you can download this tool that I have created: When you run this tool it will generate a log file that contains a list of all encrypted files found under the HKCU\\Software\\CryptoLocker\\Files or the HKCU\\Software\\CryptoLocker_0388\\Files key. Once it has completed it will automatically open this log in Notepad. Another method is to use the Windows PowerShell (thanks  ):  For systems with PowerShell, you can dump the list of files in the CryptoLocker registry key using the following command: (Get-Item HKCU:\\Software\\CryptoLocker\\Files).GetValueNames().Replace(\"?\",\"\\\") | Out-File CryptoLockerFiles.txt -Encoding unicode Make sure to include the \"-Encoding unicode\" parameter to ensure that filenames with Unicode characters are preserved. You can use the   from Omnispear to search for and list encrypted files found on your computer. This program will look for certain file identifiers that are normally found in a file based on that file's extension. If the file identifier does not exist it would indicate that the file is either encrypted or corrupted. On a large network, determining the computer that is infected with CryptoLocker can be difficult. Some infected users have reporter that encrypted files will have their ownership changed to the user that the CryptoLocker program is running under. You can then use this login name to determine the infected computer. You can also examine your network switches and look for the ports that have lights that are continuously blinking or show very heavy traffic. You can then use this to further narrow down what computers may be infected. You can use the Windows Group or Local Policy Editor to create Software Restriction Policies that block executables from running when they are located in specific paths. For more information on how to configure Software Restriction Policies, please see these articles from MS: The file paths that have been used by this infection and its droppers are: C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\<random>.exe (Vista/7/8) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Local Application Data\\<random>.exe (XP) In order to block the CryptoLocker you want to create Path Rules so that they are not allowed to execute. To create these Software Restriction Policies, you can either use the   tool or add the policies   using the Local Security Policy Editor or the Group Policy Editor. Both methods are described below. If you are using Windows Home or Windows Home Premium, the Local Security Policy Editor will not be available to you. Instead we suggest you use the   tool, which will automatically set these policies for you.  was kind enough to create a free utility called CryptoPrevent that automatically adds the suggested Software Restriction Policy Path Rules listed above to your computer. This makes it very easy for anyone using Windows XP SP 2 and above to quickly add the Software Restriction Policies to your computer in order to prevent CryptoLocker and Zbot from being executed in the first place. This tool is also able to set these policies in all versions of Windows, including the Home versions. A new feature of CryptoPrevent is the option to whitelist any existing programs in %AppData% or %LocalAppData%. This is a useful feature as it will make sure the restrictions that are put in place do not affect legitimate applications that are already installed on your computer. To use this feature make sure you check the option labeled   before you press the   button. You can download CryptoPrevent from the following page: For more information on how to use the tool, please see this page: You can use CryptoPrevent for free, but if you wish to   the premium version you can use the coupon code   to get 30% off. The premium version includes automatic and silent updating of application and definitions on a regular schedule, email alerts when an application blocked, and custom allow and block policies to fine-tune your protection. Note: BleepingComputer earns a commission from the sales of CryptoPrevent. Once you run the program, simply click on the   button to add the default Software Restriction Policies to your computer. If you wish to customize the settings, then please review the checkboxes and change them as necessary. If CryptoPrevent causes issues running legitimate applications, then please see   on how to enable specific applications. You can also remove the Software Restriction Policies that were added by clicking on the   button.  In order to manually create the Software Restriction Policies you need to be using Windows Professional or Windows Server. If you want to set these policies for a particular computer you can use the Local Security Policy Editor. If you wish to set these policies for the entire domain, then you need to use the Group Policy Editor. Unfortunately, if you are a Windows Home user, the Local Policy Editor ir not available and you should use the   tool instead to set these policies. To open the Local Security Policy editor, click on the   button and type   and select the search result that appears. You can open the Group Policy Editor by typing   instead. In this guide we will use the Local Security Policy Editor in our examples.  Once you open the Local Security Policy Editor, you will see a screen similar to the one below. Once the above screen is open, expand   and then click on the   section. If you do not see the items in the right pane as shown above, you will need to add a new policy. To do this click on the   button and select  . This will then enable the policy and the right pane will appear as in the image above. You should then click on the   category and then right-click in the right pane and select  . You should then add a Path Rule for each of the items listed below. If the Software Restriction Policies cause issues when trying to run legitimate applications, you should see   on how to enable specific applications. Below are a few Path Rules that are suggested you use to not only block the infections from running, but also to block attachments from being executed when opened in an e-mail client.    . .   You can see an event log entry and alert showing an executable being blocked: If you need help configuring this, feel free to ask in the  . If you use Software Restriction Policies, or CryptoPrevent, to block CryptoLocker you may find that some legitimate applications no longer run. This is because some companies mistakenly install their applications under a user's profile rather than in the Program Files folder where they belong. Due to this, the Software Restriction Policies will prevent those applications from running.  Thankfully, when Microsoft designed Software Restriction Policies they made it so a Path Rule that specifies a program is allowed to run overrides any path rules that may block it. Therefore, if a Software Restriction Policy is blocking a legitimate program, you will need to use the   given above to add a Path Rule that allows the program to run. To do this you will need to create a Path Rule for a particular program's executable and set the Security Level to   instead of Disallowed as shown in the image below. Once you add these Unrestricted Path Rules, the specified applications will be allowed to run again. ESET wrote a   about a new infection called CryptoLocker 2.0. Though this infection appears to be a new version of the CryptoLocker there are key differences that hint that this is just a copycat trying to benefit from the fame of the original infection. The main differences between the two are: When installed, the dropper will install the main executable as: %AppData%\\Microsoft\\msunet.exe It will then create the following registry keys to autostart the program in normal mode and safe mode.  HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\MSUpdate\t%AppData%\\Microsoft\\msunet.exe \nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\*MSUpdate\t%AppData%\\Microsoft\\msunet.exe \nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Userinit\tC:\\Windows\\system32\\userinit.exe,,%AppData%\\Microsoft\\msunet.exe The infection encrypts files with the following extensions; 3fr, accdb, txt, ai, arw, bay, cdr, cer, cr2, eps, erf, indd, mp3, mp4, jpe, jpg, kdc, mdb, mdf, mef, mrw, nef, crt, crw, dbf, dcr, der, dng, doc, docm, docx, dwg, dxf, dxg, rwl, srf, srw, wb2, wpd, wps, xlk, nrw, odb, odm, odp, ods, odt, orf, p12, p7b, p7c, pdd, xls, xlsb, xlsm, xlsx, pef, pem, pfx, ppt, pptm, pptx, psd, pst, ptx, r3d, raf, raw, rtf Over all, the developer of this malware drastically changed the approach of the original CryptoLocker. Instead of focusing on encrypting files and getting paid for the decryption key, this infection tries to throw the kitchen sink at you in order to maximize revenue. %AppData%\\<random>.exe\n%AppData%\\<random>\\<random>.exe (zbot)\n%LocalAppData%\\<random>.exe\n  refers to the current users Application Data folder. By default, this is C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Current User>\\Application Data for Windows 2000/XP.

When RKill runs it will kill malware processes and then removes incorrect executable associations and fixes policies that stop us from using certain tools. When finished it will display a log file that shows the processes that were terminated while the program was running. As RKill only terminates a program's running process, and does not delete any files, after running it you should not reboot your computer as any malware processes that are configured to start automatically will just be started again. Instead, after running RKill you should immediately scan your computer using some sort of anti-malware or anti-virus program so that the infections can be properly removed. Below are a list of RKill download links using different filenames. We offer RKill under different filenames because some malware will not allow processes to run unless they have a certain filename.

Speaking at the   on Wednesday, Neuberger defended the administration's response to cyberthreats posed by China and Russia as well as several high-profile ransomware attacks that have targeted U.S. critical infrastructure over the last several months. Neuberger, who has shaped the White House's response to many of these cyber incidents over the last eight months, pointed not only to the administration calling out Russia over the   supply chain attack and highlighting China's role in the attacks on vulnerable Exchange email servers, but also the   signed by President Joe Biden that looks to modernize the federal government's cybersecurity protections, including how software is purchased and used. \"You saw in the executive order a key component, in which we said that the U.S. government will only buy technology that is built in accordance with software security standards,\" Neuberger said. \"And clearly that doesn't just benefit the federal government. … By having the federal government define the standards and saying we'll use the power of our procurement to move the market there, this will benefit small and large businesses and individuals alike.\" When the Biden administration in July formally accused China's Ministry of State Security, aka MSS, of carrying out a series of attacks earlier this year against vulnerable on-premises Microsoft Exchange, several cybersecurity experts expressed concern that the U.S. did not impose sanctions (see:  ). One reason to hold off sanctions, however, is that the Biden administration is attempting to build a consensus among nations on how to confront China over its malicious cyber activity, Neuberger said. She noted that the   indicted four members of the MSS for their roles in other cyber campaigns. \"The Microsoft Exchange attack … emphasizes the Biden administration approach to not go at it alone, but instead to use a sequential, thoughtful approach and to bring partners along to establish those norms of accepted behavior in cyberspace,\" Neuberger said. The administration had previously sanctioned   and the government's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, for its role in the supply chain attack against SolarWinds, which led to follow-on attacks on about 100 companies and nine federal agencies. Neuberger said that Russia had a history of aggressive cyber behavior not only against the U.S. but other countries as well. \"This was not the first case of aggressive Russian cyber activity in the international space and we have seen a series of activities in Ukraine, Georgia, Germany and other parts of Europe as well,\" Neuberger noted. \"And there's a broader consensus around the need to call out [Russia's] bad behavior.\" When asked about the types of measures the Biden administration is taking in response to aggressive cyber campaigns, Neuberger pointed to the president directly confronting Russia and China over their behavior. She also pointed to new U.S. investments in cyber defenses for   to help ensure it can withstand attacks. \"The U.S. government is making efforts to modernize our defenses and to launch innovative critical infrastructure resilience efforts,\" Neuberger noted. \"We have made a massive push to say that we must address our poor level of national cyber resilience. In no small part, this is underpinned by the fact that critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector and we must encourage, incentivize and move the private sector to make the investment needed to ensure that we as a country can guarantee those critical services.\" Neuberger was less forthcoming on how the U.S. might use offensive cyber operations. She noted more aggressive steps can escalate quickly, especially considering the interconnectivity of many IT networks. \"One must always consider the interoperability of networks,\" Neuberger said. \"Having a discrete impact, having confidence in that discrete impact, is often challenging, given how much networks are interconnected within countries and globally.\" The Biden administration is also continuing to develop strategies to counter ransomware attacks, especially in the light of attacks on   and meat processor  . Ransomware was the topic at the center of the June summit meeting between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since then, two of the ransomware gangs believed responsible for some of these attacks - DarkSide and REvil - have gone quiet, although these groups may have started rebranding under new names (see:  ). In an interview this week with  , a threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future, someone claiming to be an administrator with the new ransomware group BlackMatter said that the gang would not attack critical infrastructure, but other companies would be fair game. Neuberger said she took that as a sign that the Biden administration's stance and the meeting with Putin might have had some effect on these gangs, although it's impossible to take the word of a supposed cybercriminal at face value. \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" she said. A more surefire way to disrupt ransomware is to attack the cybercriminals' business model, which includes disrupting their operations and adopting new cryptocurrency regulations, Neuberger said. \"If we want to disrupt ransomware ... we need to be able to rapidly trace and interdict [cryptocurrency payments] around the world, and there's a lot of lessons learned from physical know-your-customer and anti-money laundering global efforts that we're working to apply here,\" Neuberger noted.

On Monday, IT management and service software company   reported it had acquired the risk-based vulnerability management company RiskSense.  Three deals were announced on Tuesday.  has acquired Bellevue, Washington-based DevSecOps security firm Refactr;   has purchased aeCyberSolutions from Greenville, South Carolina-based Applied Engineering Solutions; and   closed a deal to acquire Cranbury, New Jersey-based managed security services provider VelocIT.  On Wednesday, the cloud-based financial risk management firm   reported it had acquired the behavioral biometric platform Revelock.  Financial terms of the five acquisitions were not disclosed. Ivanti says it acquired Albuquerque, New Mexico-based RiskSense with the intent of using that firm's vulnerability management and prioritization technology to help shrink customer's attack surfaces through better patch management and enable them to take steps to stop attacks.   RiskSense's staff will join Ivanti's workforce, an Ivanti spokespersons says.  Mitchell Schneider, principal research analyst at Gartner, says, \"The opportunity that Ivanti and RiskSense have taken advantage of is to enrich the threat topology with insight from both the threat and the endpoint management perspective to improve visibility into an organization's threat context.\" Sophos' acquisition of Refactr was completed with the intention of optimizing Refactr's DevSecOps automation platform to add security orchestration automation and response, or SOAR, capabilities to Sophos' managed threat response and extended detection and response solutions, the company says.  \"As we've seen in recent supply chain incidents, attackers are increasingly targeting software development pipelines, and defenders need the ability to shift further left of attackers. The industry needs SOAR to mature into more capable and generalizable DevSecOps solutions,\" says Joe Levy, chief technology officer at Sophos.  “With this acquisition, Sophos continues to build on its adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem platform that combines software, hardware and services from their own stable with an open technology alliance program for third-party integrations,” says Paul Webber,  a senior research director with Gartner.  This deal comes on the heels of Sophos' July 23 purchase of  .  Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory's acquisition of aeCyberSolutions from Greenville, South Carolina-based Applied Engineering Solutions is intended to bolster Deloitte's cybersecurity offerings for industrial control systems and operational technology security, the company says.  This acquisition marks the fifth deal announced by Deloitte Risk & Financial Advisory this year. In addition, Deloitte Consulting acquired the systems engineering and cybersecurity firm Sentek Consulting on July 23. Cerberus Sentinel said that VelocIT will become a wholly owned subsidiary, continuing its focus on providing integrated risk managed services.  VelocIT President Darek Hahn and COO Glenn Kupsch will take on executive positions with Cerberus Sentinel.  Feedzai portrays its purchase of Revelock as a first step toward building a financial intelligence network. \r\n The company seeks to tie Feedzai's Risk Ledger, which consists of 150 billion data points that are aggregated from previous financial transactions, to Revelock's biometric intelligence that's gathered from users, devices and sessions connecting to a system. It will use these two technologies to help determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Olenick has covered the cybersecurity and computer technology sectors for more than 25 years.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing came just weeks after the White House joined the European Union and NATO allies in attributing the recent campaign that exploited flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers to Chinese state-sponsored attackers (see:  ). According to testimony at the hearing, the FBI estimates that China steals $300 billion to $600 billion worth of U.S. intellectual property each year. And the U.S. Department of Justice says 60% of all trade secret theft cases have some nexus to China (see:  ). China is stealing IP through espionage campaigns to support its efforts to dominate technology development, such as for artificial intelligence and semiconductors, senators and those testifying said. Then, in turn, China could leverage the use of this technology worldwide for espionage. Plus, the Chinese Communist Party is conducting \"influence operations\" targeting policymakers, businesses and academic institutions in hopes of sowing dissent in the U.S. and potentially hampering a response to its intelligence operations, according to lawmakers and experts testifying. To deal with the threats posed by China, experts who testified recommended several steps, including: ramping up domestic tech manufacturing to curtail the reliance on Chinese tech, updating legislation on foreign agent tracking and creating a public-private information-sharing organization to monitor Chinese cyber and physical threats. \"To effectively defend against China, we must put the same effort into this threat as we did to combat terrorism the past 20 years,\" said Bill Evanina, former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. \"I would suggest [this China cyberthreat] is much more dangerous to our economic and military viability as a nation.\" The People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party are \"working to acquire critical U.S. technologies, intellectual property, hack into the U.S. cyber networks and conduct influence operations to shape narratives that are more favorable to the PRC,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chairman of the committee. The Chinese Communist Party is using cyberespionage to acquire technological capabilities, he said. And by hoarding intellectual property, China hopes to \"ensure their future dominance\" in several key areas, including AI, aerospace, advanced manufacturing, biotech, data analytics and semiconductors, he added. Warner said the government's recent efforts to limit the use of equipment from the Chinese firms   on U.S. 5G networks are necessary to help protect national security because the equipment could be used for spying. Addressing China's theft of intellectual property, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., vice chairman of the committee, added, \"Today, China is carrying out the biggest illegal wealth transfer from one nation to another in the history of mankind.\" Evanina, formerly of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, testified: \"The holistic and comprehensive threat to the U.S. posed by the Communist Party of China is an existential threat and is the most complex, pernicious, aggressive and strategic threat our nation has ever faced. [Chinese President] Xi Jinping has one goal: to be the geopolitical military and economic leader in the world, period.\" China possesses \"persistent and unending\" cybersecurity resources to penetrate U.S. systems and exfiltrate data or to plant malware on critical infrastructure for future use, Evanina warned. \"It's unnecessary for China to procure or buy [sensitive] data when they can come in and take it for free because of our lack of cybersecurity defenses,\" he testified. \"We provide an open door for them to take their spear-phishing or use other vectors to get into our systems and take our DNA and genomics data.\" If the U.S. loses its \"technological edge\" to China, that would have \"far-reaching implications,\" said Anna Puglisi, senior fellow at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. In her testimony, Puglisi described Chinese efforts to create and coordinate global \"talent programs\" to recruit specialists for intelligence gathering or for conducting cyber offensives. Matthew Pottinger, distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former deputy national security adviser for the White House, testified: \"Assembling dossiers on people has always been a feature of Leninist regimes, but Beijing's penetration of digital networks worldwide, including using 5G networks, has really taken this to a new level.\" Pottinger told senators the Communist Party compiles dossiers on millions of foreign citizens using material it gathers via cyberattacks and other means and uses that information to support social engineering campaigns to influence public officials as well as consumers. China has flooded U.S. social media platforms with overt and covert propaganda amplified by proxies and bots - all to exacerbate social tensions within the U.S., he said. Pottinger told the committee that synthetic biology, 5G networks and machine learning are all built on advanced semiconductors, and China dominates chip manufacturing. \"I believe that we need to provide subsidies to bring back a certain amount of the manufacturing of semiconductors to the U.S.,\" Pottinger testified.

Before we get to the active scanning of these vulnerabilities, it is important to understand how they have been disclosed. ProxyShell is the name for three vulnerabilities that perform unauthenticated, remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers when chained together. These chained vulnerabilities are exploited remotely through Microsoft Exchange's Client Access Service (CAS) running on port 443 in IIS. The three chained vulnerabilities used in ProxyShell attacks are: Strangely, while both   and   were first disclosed in July, they were actually quietly patched in April's Microsoft Exchange KB5001779 cumulative update. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Devcore Principal Security Researcher  , whose team received a $200,000 prize for their use in April's  . On Thursday, Orange Tsai gave a   about recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities he discovered when targeting the Microsoft Exchange Client Access Service (CAS) attack surface. As part of the talk, Tsai explained that one of the components of the ProxyShell attack chain targets the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover service. Microsoft introduced the Autodiscover service to provide an easy way for mail client software to auto-configure itself with minimal input from the user. After watching Orange Tsai's talk, security researchers PeterJson and Jang   providing technical information about how they could successfully reproduce the ProxyShell exploit. This week, security researcher   tweeted that a threat actor was probing his Microsoft Exchange honeypot against the server's  . Interesting thing I noticed in MailPot with Exchange servers - somebody has started targeting them using autodiscover.json, a detection avoidance and relatively undocumented feature it appears.  While these initial attempts were unsuccessful, last night, after more details about the vulnerability were released, attackers   disclosed in Tsai's slide above. Using the new URL, it appears that the threat actors were successfully able to detect a vulnerable system as it triggers the compilation of the ASP.NET web application.  Jang told BleepingComputer that accessing the URL will cause the ASP.NET worker process (w3wp.exe exe) to compile a web application, as shown in the image below from Beaumont's honeypot. Now that threat actors are actively scanning for vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers, Beaumont advises administrators to use Azure Sentinel to check IIS logs for the \"/autodiscover/autodiscover.json\" or \"/mapi/nspi/\" strings. If the results list the targeted Autodiscover URL, then threat actors scanned your server for the vulnerability. Threat actors are  , with little success so far. However, it is only a matter of time until successful exploitation is achieved in the wild. It is strongly advised that Microsoft Exchange admins   so they are protected from these vulnerabilities CVE-2021–34473 is one announced last month (but patch available in April). However, about 50% of internet exposed boxes aren't patched yet. As the ProxyShell vulnerabilities patches have already been released, the attacks should not be as far-reaching as the   we saw in March, which led to  , malware, and data theft on exposed servers. However, Tsai states that there are currently 400,000 Microsoft Exchange servers exposed on the Internet, so there are bound to be successful attacks.

Before we get to the active scanning of these vulnerabilities, it is important to understand how they have been disclosed. ProxyShell is the name for three vulnerabilities that perform unauthenticated, remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers when chained together. These chained vulnerabilities are exploited remotely through Microsoft Exchange's Client Access Service (CAS) running on port 443 in IIS. The three chained vulnerabilities used in ProxyShell attacks are: Strangely, while both   and   were first disclosed in July, they were actually quietly patched in April's Microsoft Exchange KB5001779 cumulative update. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Devcore Principal Security Researcher  , whose team received a $200,000 prize for their use in April's  . On Thursday, Orange Tsai gave a   about recent Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities he discovered when targeting the Microsoft Exchange Client Access Service (CAS) attack surface. As part of the talk, Tsai explained that one of the components of the ProxyShell attack chain targets the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover service. Microsoft introduced the Autodiscover service to provide an easy way for mail client software to auto-configure itself with minimal input from the user. After watching Orange Tsai's talk, security researchers PeterJson and Jang   providing technical information about how they could successfully reproduce the ProxyShell exploit.

Participants in the JCDC will include federal agencies, state and local officials, owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure, and academics and security researchers, she said.   Besides the JDCD announcement,  , whom the Senate approved as CISA director last month, called for greater collaboration between security researchers and white hat hackers. \"We know that with great power comes great responsibility,\" Easterly said. \"One of my big priorities as a director is to ensure that we are maximizing this power and that is to cultivate and strengthen the incredible partnerships that we have - in particular with industry, with academia, with researchers within the hacker community - and to ensure that we are leveraging the best and brightest of this community for the collective defense of the nation.\" Easterly said the JCDC will perform several functions, including: \"To some extent, some of these activities are already going on across the federal government, but they're running largely in stovepipes. So the idea is that we bring together our partners in the government and our private sector partners to really mature this planning capability,\" Easterly said. Besides CISA and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security, other federal government participants will include the U.S. National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command and the FBI. Easterly announced nine companies have signed up to participate,: CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. The JCDC will build on the relationships CISA has with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or ISACs, which represent various industries. The concept for the new initiative came from the  , which published its report in 2020 (see:  ). Tom Kellermann, the head of cybersecurity strategy for VMware and a member of the Cyber Investigations Advisory Board for the U.S. Secret Service, says the newly announced JCDC is a major milestone in beefing up U.S. cybersecurity. \"The collaborative will spearhead a long overdue effort to civilize American cyberspace,\" Kellermann says. \"It will dramatically improve situational awareness to systemic cyber intrusions and enhance coordination to respond and eradicate the persistence of our Cold War adversaries.\" Easterly, who succeeded   as CISA director, is taking over the agency at a time when the federal government has been dealing with a series of cyberthreats. Those include nation-state attacks, such as the SolarWinds supply chain attack and Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability exploits, and also cybercriminals' ransomware campaigns (see:  ).  recently signed an executive memorandum calling for uniform cybersecurity standards across industries that oversee critical infrastructure. In her Black Hat conference presentation, Easterly said that the proliferation of ransomware attacks, especially those that target critical sectors, such as the  , show why the new JCDC collaborative effort is essential. \"Our two initial focus areas - the first one will not surprise you - is our effort to combat ransomware. The second one is our effort to develop a planning framework to respond to cyber incidents on cloud providers,\" Easterly said. The White House is seeking additional funding for cybersecurity to shore up cyber defenses (see:  ). One of the reasons the Biden administration nominated Easterly for CISA director is her long experience in cybersecurity, which she described during her Black Hat keynote presentation. Easterly retired as an Army intelligence officer in 2011 and was then named as deputy for counterterrorism at the NSA. She later served on President Obama's National Security Council staff. After leaving the government, Easterly worked as Morgan Stanley's head of firm resilience and oversaw the company's fusion resilience center. While in the Army, Easterly worked with Gen. Keith Alexander, who was then director of the NSA, to help establish U.S. Cyber Command. During a brief Q&A session, Easterly said that one of her main objectives as director is to build trust between CISA and the research and hacking communities. She received applause for coming out in favor of strong encryption, despite other government agencies' objections (see:  ). \"We have to have strong encryption to be able to ensure the defense of our networks. It's foundational, as everybody in this audience knows,\" Easterly said. \"I realize that there are other points of view across the government. … I think strong encryption is absolutely fundamental for us to be able to do what we need to do.\" Ferguson is the managing editor for the GovInfoSecurity.com media website at Information Security Media Group.

But patches are now available.   So far, there is no evidence these flaws have been exploited, a Forescout spokesperson says. On Thursday, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released an   describing the vulnerabilities, saying users and administrators should review the   and apply the necessary updates and mitigations. NicheStack is a proprietary TCP/IP stack developed by InterNiche Technologies in 1996 and now offered by the company HCC Embedded. Users of the stack include many OT device and critical infrastructure providers and vendors, including Emerson, Honeywell, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Rockwell Automation. The flaws - which the researchers named \"INFRA:HALT\" - have the potential \"to cause even more widespread disruption at a time when we’re already seeing an increased number of attacks against multiple global utility, oil and gas, healthcare and supply chain organizations,” says Daniel dos Santos, research manager at Forescout Research Labs. “We urge organizations to take protective measures against INFRA:HALT, which requires limiting the network exposure of critical vulnerable devices via network segmentation and patching devices when vendors release patches.” HCC recommends users apply release v4.3, which contains patches to fix the issue. NicheStack is one of four embedded TCP/IP protocol stacks developed by InterNiche Technologies and now sold by HCC Embedded. It's used to connect embedded devices, such as the Siemens S7 line of PLCs. The IP layer in NicheStack is manually configurable and thus can be used as a client machine, an IP router or a multi-homed server. The vulnerabilities, if exploited, could allow attackers to carry out a variety of malicious activities. The researchers say that two of the flaws,   and  , could enable attackers to gain remote code execution privileges, which the researchers explained with a theoretical example as shown in the figure below: As illustrated, an attacker could send a specially crafted DNS request to the INTER:HALT vulnerable device. This malicious request consists of a shellcode that instructs Device 1 to send a malicious FTP packet to Device 2 on the same network, which in this example is assumed to be a programmable logic controller. The malicious FTP packet, in turn, causes the PLC to crash and ultimately leads to a complete failure of all further processes. A search on the   search engine by Forescout showed that more than 6,400 devices are running NicheStack protocol, of which 6,360 run an HTTP server. But Santos says more devices run the stack. \"Since many of the affected devices are in operational technology, they should, by definition, not be accessible over the internet. Those 6,400 are mostly in misconfigured networks,\" he says. Some 4,000 devices found in the Shodan search were in North America. The researchers said that their own database classified over 2,500 devices from 21 vendors across the globe that used NicheStack protocol. Use of the NicheStack protocol is mainly associated with industrial control systems, including in the retail and manufacturing sectors, the researchers say.  HCC Embedded released patches in May 2021 as part of version 4.3. Other mitigation steps that Santos suggests network engineers and device vendors follow are: Bagwe previously worked at CISO magazine, reporting the latest cybersecurity news and trends and interviewing cybersecurity subject matter experts. \n                                                              Covering topics in risk management, compliance, fraud, and information security.

The system, called CSAM Detection, is designed to catch offensive material that's uploaded to iCloud accounts from devices. It works partially on a device itself - a detail that privacy and security experts say could open a door to broader monitoring of devices.  \"I don’t particularly want to be on the side of child porn and I’m not a terrorist,\" tweets  , a cryptographer who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University. \"But the problem is that encryption is a powerful tool that provides privacy, and you can’t really have strong privacy while also surveilling every image anyone sends.\"  The system will be implemented later this year in iOS 15, watchOS and macOS Monterey, which is the next desktop iteration. The   reports that it will only apply to U.S. devices.  \"CSAM detection will help Apple provide valuable information to law enforcement on collections of CSAM in iCloud Photos,\" Apple says on its  . \"This program is ambitious, and protecting children is an important responsibility. These efforts will evolve and expand over time.\"  Apple is also tweaking its Messages app to address explicit content either sent or received by children. Messages will use machine learning to automatically analyze image attachments and blur content that is sexually explicit. That will happen on the device, and Apple says it does not have access to the content. Apple will also display different types of warning messages, including to parents.  \"When receiving this type of content, the photo will be blurred and the child will be warned, presented with helpful resources and reassured it is okay if they do not want to view this photo,\" Apple says.  Apple's CSAM Detection system flags abusive images before they're uploaded to iCloud. The system uses a database of known abusive material compiled by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Apple renders that database into a set of unreadable hashes using a system called NeuralHash. Images are converted into a unique number that is specific to the image. The list is then uploaded and securely stored on a user's device. The system makes it virtually impossible for someone to figure out what images would trigger a positive detection. Apple says it can also detect what is essentially the same image but with slightly different attributes.  \"Only another image that appears nearly identical can produce the same number; for example, images that differ in size or transcoded quality will still have the same NeuralHash value,\" according to an Apple  .  Apple says it's using a technique called private set intersection, or PSI, to detect photos with CSAM content and also ensure other photos remain private.  If the system detects enough matches for CSAM content, Apple will review the material and in some cases, a user's account may be disabled and a report sent to the NCMEC.  Apple says the system preserves users' privacy in that it doesn't see images that lack a match with the CSAM database. It's not entirely clear why Apple has chosen to do part of the analysis on users' devices, which some security experts find concerning.  iCloud backups are unencrypted and easy game for law enforcement agencies. There's no reason why Apple can't do CSAM scanning on the material once it has been uploaded from a device, which is already done by other cloud storage providers.  Green   the system's design may be part of an effort to perform broader device scanning, even for files not shared with iCloud and possibly also content that is encrypted end to end.  But ask yourself: why would Apple spend so much time and effort designing a system that is *specifically* designed to scan images that exist (in plaintext) only on your phone — if they didn’t eventually plan to use it for data that you don’t share in plaintext with Apple? From there, it may be a slippery slope, Green contends. Apple has \"sent a very clear signal. In their (very influential) opinion, it is safe to build systems that scan users’ phones for prohibited content. That’s the message they’re sending to governments, competing services, China, you,\" he  .  But Apple's website features three assessments of CSAM Detection from cryptography and security experts who endorsed the system.  \"In conclusion, I believe that the Apple PSI system provides an excellent balance between privacy and utility, and will be extremely helpful in identifying CSAM content while maintaining a high level of user privacy and keeping false positives to a minimum,\" writes Benny Pinkas of the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, in a  .

But cyber fusion centers can help automate that process, according to Errol Weiss of the Health Information Sharing & Analysis Center and Anuj Goel of security firm Cyware. \"To this day, there are definitely a lot of challenges in cross-sector sharing. We're not doing as much as we could be,\" Weiss says. For instance, much of the cyber information sharing in healthcare occurs among members of H-ISAC, he notes.  But, the use of cyber fusion centers - such as those developed by H-ISAC and some other sector ISACs - is helping to automate cross-member and cross-sector intelligence sharing and response to   and advanced threats, Weiss says in an interview with Information Security Media Group. Cyber fusions are \"becoming next-gen   … helping to enable collaboration … and gain more continuous alerting and actionable intelligence,\" Goel notes in the same interview. \"Each ISAC needs to automate their environment first before they share from ISAC to ISAC,\" Goel says. \"Silos can begin   more tactical, technical or operational   and enhance situational awareness. They can also share vulnerability and malware alerts in real time, as opposed to sitting on those for many hours.\" In this interview (see audio link below photos), Weiss and Goel also discuss: Weiss joined the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center in April 2019 as its first CSO. He has over 25 years of experience in information security. He previously was a senior vice president executive with Bank of America’s global information security team and created and ran Citigroup’s Cyber Intelligence Center. Goel is CEO and co-founder of security firm Cyware. He has more than 20 years of experience in the security industry, including serving as the head of global strategy and planning covering information security at Citigroup. Goel was also an executive committee member of the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council and has participated in several leading information-sharing initiatives.

According to just one report, 7.9 billion records were exposed in the first nine months of 2019. This compounds the burden on already stretched IT teams who are tasked with tackling the daily challenges precipitated by shadow IT, cloud computing, containers, zero-trust, and software-defined everything.  And what do most observers see as the common culprit for all of this chaos? Visibility gaps. To find out more about the challenges that organizations face, Tanium commissioned independent market-research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey 750 IT decision makers across the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, and Canada.

Threat actors actively exploit a critical authentication bypass vulnerability impacting home routers with Arcadyan firmware to take them over and deploy Mirai botnet malicious payloads. The commonly used \"net\" library in Go and Rust languages is also impacted by the mixed-format IP address validation vulnerability. The bug has to do with how \"net\" treats IP addresses as decimal, even when they are provided in a mixed (octal-decimal) format, and therefore making applications vulnerable to SSRF and RFI. If there is one thing we learned this week, it's that not only are corporations vulnerable to insider threats but so are ransomware operations. A free unofficial patch is now available to block attackers from taking over domain controllers and compromising entire Windows domains via PetitPotam NTLM relay attacks. In a Thursday security advisory update, Cisco revealed that a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Adaptive Security Device Manager (ADSM) Launcher disclosed last month is a zero-day bug that has yet to receive a security update. ​Taiwanese motherboard maker Gigabyte has suffered a RansomEXX ransomware attack where threat actors threaten to release 112 GB of data if a ransom is not paid. ​The BlackMatter gang has joined the ranks of ransomware operations to develop a Linux encryptor that targets VMware's ESXi virtual machine platform. CISA has announced the launch of Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), a partnership across public and private sectors focused on defending US critical infrastructure from ransomware and other cyber threats. Security researchers found a new class of DNS vulnerabilities impacting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers that could allow attackers to access sensitive information from corporate networks. A disgruntled Conti affiliate has leaked the gang's training material when conducting attacks, including information about one of the ransomware's operators. A free unofficial patch has been released to protect Windows users from all new PrintNightmare zero-day vulnerabilities discovered since June. Security researchers investigating multiple malware distribution campaigns found that an underground traffic distribution service called Prometheus is responsible for delivering threats that often lead to ransomware attacks. Google says that enforcing two-step verification on Google accounts of Chrome Web Store developers will take longer than expected. ​Researchers have discovered a way for users on Telegram for Mac to keep specific self-destructing messages forever or view them without the sender ever knowing. Microsoft has announced that the Edge Vulnerability Research team is experimenting with a new feature dubbed \"Super Duper Secure Mode\" and designed to bring security improvements without significant performance losses. Italian energy company ERG reports \"only a few minor disruptions\" affecting its information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure following a ransomware attack on its systems. Cisco has addressed pre-auth security vulnerabilities impacting multiple Small Business VPN routers and allowing remote attackers to trigger a denial of service condition or execute commands and arbitrary code on vulnerable devices. The LockBit 2.0 ransomware gang is actively recruiting corporate insiders to help them breach and encrypt networks. In return, the insider is promised million-dollar payouts. High-severity and critical vulnerabilities collectively referred to as INFRA:HALT are affecting all versions of NicheStack below 4.3, a proprietary TCP/IP stack used by at least 200 industrial automation vendors, many in the leading segment of the market.

Once you realize you can move all your users to WFH in days instead of years, you start to wonder what else you can do quickly. What digital transformation projects, long considered a moonshot, might turn out to require far more down-to-earth efforts? What new projects become more feasible? If massive changes are possible, how should IT organizations budget for 2021 and 2022? Tanium partnered with PSB Insights, a global custom research and analytics consultancy, to answer those questions and more. PSB Insights surveyed IT decision-makers (ITDMs) at 500 enterprises. Half were in the U.S. and half in the U.K., distributed across a variety of industries, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. More than half of the respondents are C-level decision-makers. In this report, we’ll share highlights from their survey and offer suggestions for IT decision-makers as they accelerate digital transformation in 2021 and beyond.

The RAT is included in a document named Манифест.docx, or Manifest.docx, which downloads and executes two templates. One is macro-enabled, while the other is an html object that contains an Internet Explorer exploit,   says. \"The first template contains a URL to download a remote template that has an embedded full-featured VBA [Visual Basic for Applications] RAT. This RAT has several different capabilities, including downloading, uploading and executing files,\" the report says. The VBA RAT collects victim information, identifies the anti-virus product running on a victim’s machine, executes shell codes, deletes files, uploads and downloads files, and reads disk and file systems information. \"The second template is an exploit for  , an Internet Explorer memory corruption vulnerability, which executes a shell-code to deploy the same VBA RAT. The VBA RAT is not obfuscated but still uses some interesting techniques for shell-code injection,\" Malwarebytes reports. \"Remote template injection is a common technique that is usually used by many threat actors. But what makes this attack different is that it loads two remote templates - something we have not seen before. One of the loaded templates, which is a working exploit for CVE-2021-26411, is also a new exploit,\" Hossein Jazi, author of the Malwarebytes report told Information Security Media Group. Another novelty is the use of the VBA RAT. Threat actors, says Jazi, usually use maldocs to download a remote template to drop a final RAT, an executable. In this case, however, the final RAT is a VBA RAT that has been embedded within the downloaded remote template, he adds. The Internet Explorer exploit was previously used by the  . After loading the remote templates, the malicious document loads a decoy document in Russian, the report says. The decoy document contains a statement from an undisclosed group within Crimea that voices opposition to Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s policies regarding that peninsula, it says. \"The decoy document contains a manifesto that shows a possible motive - Crimea - and target - Russian and pro-Russian individuals - behind this attack. However, it could also have been used as a false flag,\" the report adds. The Malwarebytes team, however, could not determine the threat actors responsible based on the techniques alone.

CVES text CVE-2021-26411 \"Remote template injection is a common technique that is usually used by many threat actors. But what makes this attack different is that it loads two remote templates - something we have not seen before.

The attackers' unusual techniques point to the need for organizations to ramp up defenses against these types of attacks, which eventually could target employees' credentials.  Researchers at the   says they \"observed a phish using a rather unorthodox tactic of acquiring PayPal credentials.\" The researchers found that the campaign not only creates a typical “forms” page or spoofed logins, but also uses a carefully crafted email that appears to be legitimate unless a recipient dives into the headers and links. The subject line notes that the email is trying to initiate a live chat to discuss a service notice related to the target’s PayPal account. \"This may rush the target into attempting to have the problem resolved quickly. Despite this, the threat actor made no attempts at masking the “from” address, which the PDC [Primary Domain Controller - a service in a Windows server that manages security for its local domain] identified as one that’s not associated with legitimate PayPal emails,\" says Alex Geoghagan, security researcher at Cofense Phishing Defense Center. The malicious email also contains a “Help & Contact” link as well as a “Learn to Identify Phishing” link, both leading to authentic PayPal links. But, Geoghagan notes, \"when hovering over the button labelled “Confirm Your Account,” it does not lead to a PayPal URL. It instead leads to a URL at direct[.]lc[.]chat. A user familiar with PayPal may notice at this point that they are being taken to a domain outside of PayPal, while the legitimate PayPal live chat is hosted within the PayPal domain and requires that you log in to use it.\" When a victim visits the fraudulent live chat, the threat actor utilizes automated scripts to start communication. The attacker initially attempts to get an email address and phone number from the victim. \"It can safely be assumed that the threat actor is gathering this information to convey legitimacy or to collect sufficient information for authentication,\" according to the Cofense report. \"The attacker will continue to use this automated script, and then step in where the script fails in order to directly interact with the victim. This is probably to reduce their own workload throughout the attack,\" Geoghagan states. Once the threat actor acquires the phone number and an attempt to verify the email address has been made, the attackers then will try to get credit card information from the target, the Cofense report notes. \"Finally, a verification code is sent via SMS to the target using the phone number provided earlier. By using this code, it can be inferred that the phone number given by the victim is live and the target is the individual who has access to the device,\" the researchers note. \"After acquiring the right amount of information from the target, the threat actor will supposedly attempt to call their target. However, as they stated, they will only call the target if they are able to verify the entirety of information given to them.\" Nair is principal correspondent for Information Security Media Group's global news desk.

The technique was first spotted in  , according to   research unit. But Microsoft is issuing a fresh warning about the campaigns, contending they're much more dangerous than it first realized. Microsoft calls the campaign \"BazaCall.\" \"In our observation, attacks emanating from the BazaCall threat could move quickly within a network, conduct extensive data exfiltration and credential theft, and distribute ransomware within 48 hours of the initial compromise,\" write   of Microsoft's 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team.  The end result may be an infection with Ryuk or Conti - ransomware believed to be pushed by a Russia-based group known as   and its affiliates. The  , which publishes deep technical dives into attacks, on Sunday published a   of a BazaCall attack that led to Trickbot malware being installed, and, eventually, Conti.  BazaCall campaigns kick off with a targeted spam email as a lure. The email may warn that an expensive subscription, such as one for a photo editing service or a recipe website, may be automatically renewed. More recent BazaCall emails purport to be confirmation receipts for a purchased software license, Carroll and Hacker write.  The emails only appear to be target people on a consumer-type way, but the attackers are interested in enterprise targets.  \"It is likely that the attackers are using consumer-type lures because they're aiming this at a wide variety of people and hoping that many of them use their work emails for personal subscriptions,\" says Hacker, a threat intelligence analyst.  The emails, however, contain no links or malicious attachments, which are triggers that send a message off to quarantine. The emails come from a different sender each time and are sent through free email services. The emails often purport to come from companies that are similar in name to those of real businesses in case people run a quick search.  The messages \"instruct users to call a phone number in case they have questions or concerns,\" Carroll and Hacker write. \"This lack of typical malicious elements - links or attachments - adds a level of difficulty in detecting and hunting for these emails.\"  Hacker tells ISMG the use of a call center may give the operation a greater air of legitimacy as people have become more alert about suspicious links and attachments in emails. Attackers may also achieve a \"higher chance of success versus a traditional link or attachment-based phish, where the attacker is reliant on the user completing all necessary steps on their own.\"\r\n\r\n An audio recording of a call to one of the BazaCall numbers was published on March 30 by  . The call center employee guides the victim to a website where they are directed to enter a subscription number.  Carroll and Hacker write that the subscription number or other numbers serve as identifiers to those executing and tracking the campaign.  The call center employee then guides the victim to a website that looks like a legitimate business. The victim is then instructed to download a file, such as an Excel spreadsheet.  In the audio call, the user is guided to enable macros after a warning is displayed. Eventually, the victim is told that their subscription has been successfully canceled, but instead, the BazaLoader malware has been installed.  The infected computer is then ready for the next stage of the attack.  The macro creates a new folder and copies certutil.exe, a legitimate tool, in that folder. Certutil.exe then connects to BazaLoader's infrastructure. Eventually, the malware retrieves a Cobalt Strike beacon. Cobalt Strike is a penetration testing toolkit, and its   is a tool for delivering payloads, issuing commands and performing tasks on a target's network.  \"Now with direct access, the attacker performs reconnaissance on the network and searches for local administrators and high-privilege domain administrator account information,\" Carroll and Hacker write.  The attackers may then hunt around for Active Directory and then use  , a tool for querying Active Directory. They may also try to pull a copy of the NTDS.dit Active Directory database, which includes user information and password hashes for all users in the domain.  \"Once the attacker has established a list of target devices on the network, they use Cobalt Strike’s custom, built-in   functionality to move laterally to the targets,\" Carroll and Hacker write. \"Each device the attacker lands on establishes a connection to the Cobalt Strike C2 server.\"  In some cases, it appears the attackers are just interested in exfiltrating data. But in others, it's ransomware time. The time span between the initial compromise and when ransomware is deployed may be as little as 48 hours, Carroll and Hacker write.  \"In those cases where ransomware was dropped, the attacker used high-privilege compromised accounts in conjunction with Cobalt Strike’s PsExec functionality to drop a Ryuk or Conti ransomware payload onto network devices,\" Carroll and Hacker write.

The 47-page report prepared by the staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which was released Tuesday, states: \"Inspectors general identified many of the same issues that have plagued federal agencies for more than a decade.\" Despite being cited for these same shortcomings in a similar report in 2019, the departments of State, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education - and the Social Security Administration - are still failing to meet even basic cybersecurity standards, the report concludes. Only the Department of Homeland Security was credited with improving its security since the last report was issued. Among the congressional report's findings: The Transportation Department had no record of thousands of IT assets being used by its staff. The State Department had active accounts for workers who had left the agency. And unauthorized shadow IT devices are in use at HUD.  The data for the latest report was compiled using the 2020 annual audit findings from the eight agencies' inspectors general.  The report finds that the seven federal agencies \"still have not met the basic cybersecurity standards necessary to protect America's sensitive data.\" This is particularly troubling, the report states, because nearly 31,000 information security incidents were reported across the federal government in 2020, an 8% increase from 2019.  \"Large-scale cyber incidents like  and  illustrate the considerable threats facing federal agencies,\" the report says. \"These attacks also make the longstanding vulnerabilities repeatedly documented by inspector generals all the more concerning. Unpatched critical vulnerabilities and shadow IT make breaching agencies' networks and stealing sensitive data easier and cheaper, at a time when the federal government should be making it harder and more expensive.\"  Among the report's findings: The report also states that the seven agencies continue to use legacy unsupported computer systems, and six of the agencies failed to install patches.  The report calls for a coordinated approach to cybersecurity across the entire government, including designating a primary office to coordinate with all agencies to develop and implement a cybersecurity strategy for the entire federal government.  It recommends that the Office of Management and Budget enforce the adoption of a risk-based strategy when budgeting for IT and security improvements so agencies would only spend money on actual, and not perceived, risks to their systems. The report also recommends that DHS provide to Congress a plan to update the Einstein intrusion detection system and justify its cost.  And it calls for Congress to update the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 to include current security practices, formalize the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's role as the lead federal agency for cybersecurity and require contractors and agencies to notify CISA of certain cyber incidents.  Meanwhile, National Cyber Director  , while speaking at an Atlantic Council virtual event, called attention to a recommendation made by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to establish the Bureau of Cyber Statistics within DHS to collect, analyze and publicly disseminate information on cyber incidents.  Data would be reported to the bureau every 180 days by cybersecurity first responders and cyber insurance carriers, Inglis said. This would help support the development of cybersecurity standards for  , he added.  \"I would observe that to properly address risk, we have to first understand it,\" he said.

As in other Chinese cyberattacks, these APT campaigns exploited flaws in Microsoft Exchange servers.   The researchers uncovered several previously unidentified cyberattack campaigns infiltrating major providers and evading detection since at least 2017, Cybereason says. Researchers identified three clusters of attacks associated with the campaign that it attributed to the Chinese APTs Soft Cell, Naikon and Threat Group-3390. The firm says overlaps in the attackers' tactics, techniques and procedures suggest a connection between the groups. \"It is not surprising that the telcos targeted in these intrusions are located in ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries, some of which have long-term, publicly known disputes with the People’s Republic of China,\" Cybereason says in its report The security firm says at one time, each cluster was observed in the same environment, operating on the same endpoints at around the same time. \"One thing is certain: All three threat actors are operating on behalf of Chinese state interests,\" says Assaf Dahan, senior director, head of threat research at Cybereason. Telecoms were compromised to facilitate espionage against specific targets - likely corporations, political figures, government officials, law enforcement agencies, political activists and dissidents of interest to the Chinese government, Cybereason says. \"The attackers exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of data collected from the network,\" Dahan says. \"Knowing the threat actors targeted major servers … gives us an indication that PII was also likely compromised.\" The findings follow U.S. President Joe Biden's recent rebuke of Chinese cyber activity, blaming the nation for another series of attacks, detected in January, that exploited vulnerabilities in unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers. The U.S. said last month the criminal group responsible for the attacks - which Microsoft called Hafnium - worked for China's Ministry of State Security, which oversees foreign intelligence operations (see:  ). The new Cybereason report finds that the Chinese APT groups conducted an \"adaptive, persistent and evasive\" campaign to obscure activity and maintain persistence on infected systems. The telecom espionage campaign, like the earlier Hafnium attacks, exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers to gain access to targeted networks and then proceeded to compromise critical assets - including domain controllers and billing systems with sensitive call detail record data, Cybereason says. \"These attacks compromised telcos primarily in ASEAN countries, but the attacks could be replicated against telcos in other regions,\" the security firm says. \"While the prevailing assessment is that the operations were intended for espionage purposes only, the fact remains that had the attackers decided to change their objectives from espionage to interference, they would have had the ability to disrupt communications for any of the affected telecoms' customers.\" Lior Div, CEO and co-founder of Cybereason, notes: \"The attacks are very concerning because they undermine the security of critical infrastructure providers and expose the confidential and proprietary information of both public and private organizations that depend on secure communications for conducting business.\" State-sponsored espionage operations \"not only negatively impact customers and business partners; they also have the potential to threaten the national security of countries in the region and those who have a vested interest in the region's stability,\" Div adds. Cybereason attributes one cluster of attacks to Soft Cell, an APT group in operation since 2012 that had previously targeted telecom providers in the same region of Southeast Asia. Telemetry and forensic evidence shows that the naming conventions, tools and TTPs in this cluster are similar to those attributed to Soft Cell in  . Researchers say Soft Cell: Cybereason attributes another cluster of activity, first observed in late 2020, to the Naikon APT, based on the unique TTPs involved, including tools and command-and-control server infrastructure. Researchers say this APT: A third cluster involved deployment of a custom Outlook Web Access backdoor used to harvest credentials, Cybereason reports. Activity dates back to 2017; backdoor deployment continued into this year, including a sharp uptick in March, perhaps in response to Microsoft's patches for its Exchange Server vulnerabilities. Code analysis shows similarities with the backdoors \"Dllshellexc2007\" and \"Dllshellexc2010,\" discovered by TrendMicro and attributed to Group-3390, or APT27, aka Emissary Panda. For example: Last month, the U.S. indicted four Chinese nationals connected to the nation's Ministry of State Security over an alleged hacking campaign conducted from 2011 to 2018 that targeted universities and government entities to obtain trade secrets, medical research and other intellectual property (see:  ).

In 2019, San Francisco-based mobile game developer Zynga suffered a data breach that exposed users' personal details, including email addresses, passwords and some phone numbers and Facebook IDs. As a result, the company faced four class action lawsuits. But last week, a judge ordered that the case be thrown out, although she has left open the door for plaintiffs to amend their complaint. \"The court grants the motion to compel arbitration and grants the motion to dismiss for lack of standing with leave to amend,\" U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wrote in her Friday  . Her reasoning: Users whose data was exposed agreed to terms and conditions specifying that any disagreements would be resolved via arbitration, and they also haven't been able to prove they suffered any financial harm from the breach. Founded in 2007, publicly traded Zynga is known for games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends, a popular multiplayer word game that is similar to the classic board game Scrabble. Earlier this year, the company said it had 164 million monthly active users. On Sept. 12, 2019, Zynga warned customers that it had suffered a data breach (see:  ).  \"Cyberattacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,\" the company's initial data breach notification stated. \"We recently discovered that certain player account information may have been illegally accessed by outside hackers. An investigation was immediately commenced, leading third-party forensics firms were retained to assist, and we have contacted law enforcement.\" As   reported at the time, a prolific Pakistani hacker known as Gnosticplayers claimed to be behind the attack, resulting in the theft of customer account information for more than 218 million users of Words With Friends. \"Hundreds of millions of people, including plaintiffs, trusted and believed Zynga's promise to protect their personally identifying information,\" reads the latest consolidated class action complaint filed on March 12 against Zynga, which includes 27 counts - or causes for action. \"Yet despite its promise, Zynga failed to protect its customers' PII by, among other things, using outdated password encryption methods that were banned for use by federal governmental agencies as early as 2010.\" That's a reference to the site having stored some passwords using the SHA-1 algorithm, which even at that time was an outdated approach that was relatively easy for hackers to crack. Many security experts have long warned organizations to not use SHA-1, but rather to use a fit for purpose password-hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt. Zynga has continued to argue in court that the lawsuit should be moved to arbitration. After the consolidated class action was filed on April 27, Zynga again made a motion to compel arbitration for part of the claims, as well as to dismiss the other parts of the lawsuit, asserting that they had no Article III standing and also failed to state a claim. Seeing lawsuits get filed by U.S. residents after their personal details get exposed in a data breach is common. But so, too, is seeing those lawsuits get dismissed after judges rule that the \"plaintiffs' bar\" - the group of attorneys representing plaintiffs - failed to prove that victims suffered an actual or threatened injury, under what's known as Article III standing, legal experts say (see:  ). In cases in which financial information, such as bank account or credit card numbers, has been exposed, the relevant financial services firms will often directly reimburse any losses. In some cases, courts have allowed lawsuits to proceed because of the identity theft threat posed by exposed information. When that happens, defendants typically agree to settle a case, rather than risk a jury imposing an unexpected penalty and an unfavorable precedent being set (see:  ). Following the breach notification, a Zynga spokeswoman declined to tell Information Security Media Group what types of data were exposed. But Gnosticplayers told The Hacker News that compromised Zynga information included: The plaintiffs also alleged that \"credit card information and other personally identifying information\" might have been exposed, and that approximately \"172 [million] to 218 million user records\" in total appear to have been compromised. As a result of financial information allegedly having been exposed, the plaintiffs said that \"since the Zynga data breach, Zynga's customers have been exposed to credit and identity theft, 'credit stuffing,' phishing scams and other illegal and fraudulent conduct perpetrated by the criminal actors who have come into possession of the stolen PII, either through purchase of the same on the dark web or through the theft of the PII during the data breach itself.\" The lawsuit says some of the victims included minors, and notes that Zynga offered no credit monitoring services to victims following the breach. The judge, however, wasn't convinced that the data breach victims faced any actual financial damage. As a result, the Zynga case appears set to move in a different direction: to arbitration. This typically involves a former judge agreeing to hear both sides and then issuing a legally binding decision, although this can sometimes be appealed to another arbitrator. In her order, Rogers wrote that the plaintiffs had agreed to Zynga's 2019 terms and conditions, which included an arbitration agreement, and found that the plaintiffs had entered no valid challenge against that clause. She upheld Zynga's motion to dismiss this part of the complaint, although she gave the plaintiffs time to amend their complaint. In terms of damages, \"the court finds that, as currently pled, the complaint fails to establish a sufficiently concrete injury-in-fact as required for Article III standing,\" Rogers wrote. \"Specifically, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an invasion of privacy or a risk of future harm based on the information allegedly stolen in the breach.\" Accordingly, she upheld Zynga's motion to dismiss this part of the lawsuit based on lack of Article III standing, although she again gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint. As that indicates, the case isn't over yet. Plaintiffs have until Aug. 27 to file an amended complaint, and Zynga has until Sept. 20 to respond. \"Should the amended complaint survive an Article III standing challenge, Zynga shall be permitted to reassert its challenge to the merits,\" the judge wrote.

In a newly released report, researchers at vpnMentor say they discovered the exposed database on April 16 and notified OneMoreLead on April 20, after which the vendor secured it. \"OneMoreLead was storing all this information on an unsecured database, which the company had left completely open,\" vpnMentor says in a new report. \"As a result, the names, email addresses and workplace information were exposed to anyone with a web browser. Had malicious hackers discovered this database, it would have been a gold mine for various criminal activities, from financial fraud and identity theft, to large-scale phishing attacks targeting U.S. companies and government institutions.\" The researchers say numerous email addresses belonging to U.S. government agencies and the New York Police Department were included in the exposed database. OneMoreLead is a data broker service that offers dynamic data lists to use for sales and marketing. The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Noam Rotem, a vpnMentor researcher, says the exposed information potentially could have been used for financial fraud, identify theft or effective phishing campaigns. \"It was not just individuals that were put at risk but also their employers as the type of information leaked meant there was a strong chance of business email compromise risk,\" Rotem says. \"Simultaneously, some government email addresses were found in the database. This can also be a gold mine for criminal hackers who could use this data to infiltrate otherwise secure, high-level government agencies, resulting in major national security breaches.\" About 34 gigabytes of data belonging to between 63 million and 126 million people in the U.S. were uploaded to a misconfigured Elasticsearch server on April 10, vpnMentor reports. The database was discoverable via the   search engine. Elasticsearch is a popular, open-source search engine and analytics platform used for large stores of data. Like Amazon S3 buckets, MongoDB and other cloud-based databases, Elasticsearch does not expose data to the internet by default. But many administrators appear to have disabled its built-in security controls (see:  ). Ran Locar, another investigator and vpnMentor researcher, says exposure of data on unsecure databases is becoming more common. “Any leak like this could be easily avoided with some basic security measures, including securing servers, implementing proper access rules and never leaving a system that doesn’t require authentication open to the internet,” Locar notes. During the investigation, researchers noticed that the exposed data appeared similar to data leaked by German B2B marketing company Leadhunter in 2020. \"Leadhunter denied responsibility for the leak at the time, and researchers couldn’t confirm a link,\" the researchers say. \"Based on our research, and the similarities between the two companies and data breaches, we suspect that both of the companies sourced their data from the same entity - possibly another business that sells leads to marketing companies. But since it's been over a year, OneMoreLead added more leads and removed some existing ones which would explain the differences between both databases,\" the researchers note.

So he knows exactly what CISOs should be conveying - and how. \n                                                             \n                                                                 • \n                                 \n                                 \n                             During the past year-plus of digital transformation, many enterprises have not just migrated to the cloud but to hybrid cloud environments. David Hill of Veeam says two security measures - data portability and protection - are often overlooked. \n                                                             \n                                                                 • \n                                 \n                                 \n                             Legacy technology.

Microsoft says it recently patched the flaws.   Palo Alto Networks did not report on whether any exploits using the vulnerabilities were found in the wild,  however Tao Yan, security researcher with the Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 team tells Information Security Group that its researchers reported around 100 Jet vulnerabilities to Microsoft in 2020, though Microsoft only fixed a small number of them. \"It seems that Microsoft's strategy is to mitigate the whole attack surface instead of fixing each individual vulnerability, one by one,\" Yan says.  IIS is a general-purpose web server that runs on Windows, while SQL Server is a relational database management system. Palo Alto Networks described the exploits in a presentation at the recent   event. The exploits take advantage of remote database access supported in Microsoft Jet Database Engine, including Jet Red Database Engine and Access Connectivity Engine, the researchers say. \"When misused, the feature allows attackers to execute SQL queries on the fully controlled database file on the remote attacker’s controlled server,\" the researchers explain. \"Once the remote legitimate database file is replaced with a malformed database file, executing SQL queries on it could break the code precondition and assumptions in Microsoft Jet/ACE, leading to vulnerabilities in many Jet components. \"The typical attack scenarios are SQL injection and ad hoc. In these two scenarios, attackers can execute any SQL queries on the malformed databases in the IIS and SQL server. The resulting Jet vulnerabilities will impact the IIS and SQL server.\" Users can assign a remote database when executing SQL queries on tables by adding a database path ahead of the table in MS Jet and using  ,   or   in ACE. Remote database access allows attackers to replace a legitimate database with a malformed one, the researchers say.  During code development and testing in MS Jet and ACE, developers might not consider the possibility of the database being malformed, so the researchers decided to explore the idea of mutating both SQL queries and database files. It was using that  fuzzing strategy that enabled the researchers to discovered the 100 vulnerabilities in MS Jet and ACE. Most of the vulnerabilities could be used to attack IIS and SQL Server under SQL injection and ad hoc scenarios, the researchers say. Palo Alto Networks says, \"any components supporting MS Jet and ACE on Windows could be vulnerable, as long as the component allows users to execute any query on the controllable database with MS Jet and ACE.\" Microsoft has assigned the flaws the designation   and released a patch. The patch introduces an option to   in the MS Jet component and ACE component. By default, no changes are made to accessing the Jet Red Database Engine or the ACE by installing these updates, a Microsoft spokesperson tells Information Security Media Group. Plus, Microsoft has provided   on blocking access to remote databases. Microsoft recommends customers with any app compatibility issues consider  . Although the patch mitigates the risks, it is not turned on by default - and most Jet vulnerabilities are still not patched, Palo Alto Networks says. \"The mitigation for the attack surface in ACE still remains imperfect, and we are working with Microsoft to release a complete patch for both MS Jet and ACE,\" Yan told ISMG. The Microsoft Jet Database Engine, including MS Jet and ACE, is over 20 years old, and a vast majority of the Jet modules have been found to be easily exploitable due to limited exploit mitigations, the researchers note. \"The remote database access feature connects the Jet vulnerabilities with IIS and SQL server components, thereby downgrading their security to the same level as the Jet Database Engine,\" they add.

The guidance, released on Tuesday, reviews the security challenges in Kubernetes environments and describes hardening strategies for these infrastructures. These include such measures such as adopting network separation, deploying authentication and implementing misconfiguration management. \"The report details recommendations to harden Kubernetes systems,\" the agencies note. \"Primary actions include the scanning of containers and pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, and using network separation, strong authentication and log auditing. Although this guidance is tailored to national security systems and critical infrastructure organizations, administrators of federal and state, local, tribal and territorial government networks are also encouraged to implement the recommendations provided.\"  Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system used to automate deploying, scaling and managing containerized applications. The agencies note that hackers target Kubernetes for data theft and denial-of-service attacks. They describe risks, including:\r\n The guidance recommends several steps that can be taken to strengthen Kubernetes containers. These include: The NSA and CISA also warn that threat actors have been leveraging the computational power of Kubernetes for cryptomining attacks. In July, security firm Intezer uncovered a hacking campaign that targeted Kubernetes environments using misconfigured Argo Workflows to deploy cryptominers (see:  ). In June, researchers at Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 reported on a TeamTNT campaign that targeted Kubernetes clusters and created new malware called Black-T that integrated with open-source cloud-native tools to assist in their cryptojacking operations (see:  ). Another report by Unit 42 described a malware variant that targeted poorly protected or misconfigured Windows containers to access Kubernetes clusters (see:  ).

But those algorithms remained secret, and workers had no way to appeal any such assessment. In addition, the regulator said, the firms could not prove that their algorithms were not being discriminatory. As a result, Italy's data protection authority, known as the Garante, on Monday announced a 2.9 million euro ($3 million) fine against Deliveroo for violating the EU's  . The penalty follows the Garante announcing on July 5 that after an investigation into the Italian operations of Foodinho, it would be fining that online food delivery platform 2.6 million euros ($3.1 million) for violating GDPR. It also issued an injunction requiring specific improvements to be made. \"Both cases have important lessons for technology businesses in particular and show some of the conflicts between AI and GDPR,\" says attorney  , a partner at London-based law firm Cordery. Deliveroo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Garante's findings, nor did Foodinho, which reportedly has plans to appeal the fine. Foodinho, owned by Barcelona, Spain-based Glovoapp23, is an on-demand food delivery service that was raided over a two-day period in June 2019 by the Garante as part of a joint investigation with Spain's data protection authority, known as the AEPD. The AEPD's investigation into Foodinho's Spanish operations is ongoing. The business also operates in 22 other countries across Africa, Europe, Asia and Central and South America. The   says it found that algorithms being used by the company to manage its Italian workers - for booking them shifts and assigning them deliveries - were violating those workers' rights. The Garante reports that all delivery personnel or \"riders\" - typically, bicyclists or moped drivers - initially got scored with a default value, which subsequently was adjusted based on the following characteristics and weightings: Workers with a higher score gained the ability to book new working slots before others. But the Garante found that the company's practices failed to honor its workers' rights. \"The company, for example, had not adequately informed the workers on the functioning of the system and did not guarantee the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used for the evaluation of the riders,\" the regulator says. \"Nor did it guarantee procedures to protect the right to obtain human intervention, express one's opinion and contest the decisions adopted through the use of the algorithms in question, including the exclusion of a part of the riders from job opportunities.\" As a result, the Garante ordered Foodinho to modify its systems to verify that booking and assignment algorithms were not discriminating against them, as well as to modify some overly long personal data retention practices The Garante has ordered the company to pay a 2.6 million euro fine, based not only on the AI problems, but also on the company failing to have in place a data protection officer and not keeping sufficient records. The amount of the fine, it said, also took into account \"the limited collaboration offered by the company during the investigation and the high number of riders involved in Italy - about 19,000 at the time of the inspection.\" Cordery's Armstrong says the algorithms being used by Foodinho were found to be in violation of Article 22 of GDPR, which concerns \"automated individual decision-making, including profiling.\" \"Under GDPR Article 22, individuals have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them, unless certain exceptions apply and specific protections for those individuals are in place,\" the attorneys say. \"The investigation found that the platform's use of algorithms to automatically penalize riders by excluding them from job opportunities if their ratings fell below a certain level was discriminatory, and the fact that there was no opportunity for human review nor the ability to challenge the decision contravened GDPR.\" On Monday, meanwhile, the Garante announced its  , dated July 22. Founded in 2013, London-based Roofoods does business as Deliveroo, operating not just in Italy and the U.K., but also in the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Ireland and Spain as well as in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. In June 2019, as part of its probe of food delivery businesses, the Garante raided Deliveroo's offices, gathering information and conducting interviews over a two-day period. Based on the Garante's penalty notice, here's how the system worked: Deliveroo's Italian operation relied on a centralized system hosted in a data center in Ireland, which it was using to support 8,000 self-employed contractors for riders. Each rider signed an agreement with Deliveroo and then received access to an app they had to install on their mobile device that they used whenever on a shift. For the Italian operation of Deliveroo, managers fed information into the Ireland-based central system, which would rate the riders' performance, but without revealing the logic that was being used. The Italian operation told regulators that \"it has access only to the data it can influence, feeding the shared database, without deciding the logic of the processing.\" The Garante found that information being used to rate riders included: More highly rated riders had access to busier and more lucrative shifts. But as with the Foodinho case, among other problems, the Garante said its investigation found multiple transparency and fairness issues surrounding how Deliveroo used algorithms to assign work. For example, GDPR Article 5, \"Principles relating to processing of personal data,\" states that personal data must be \"processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.\" \"As part of that, a controller should be able to show that its algorithm is not discriminatory,\" Armstrong say. \"Deliveroo said that it had changed platforms since the inspection but the Garante emphasized that it was incumbent on Deliveroo 'to verify, on a periodic basis, the correctness of the results of the algorithms to minimize the risk of distorted or discriminatory effects.'\" Armstrong says that the two Italian cases offer lessons for any organization that uses \"algorithmic management of staff.\" For starters, he   all such organizations must first carry out a data protection impact assessment, thoroughly test their algorithms for any signs of bias and inform employees about how algorithms are being used to make important decisions about them - while also explaining, in an easy-to-understand manner, how the algorithms function. Understanding current norms for AI use can also help. \"Ask around: Ethics committees and/or employee focus groups can be useful temperature checks for gauging whether measures are likely to be perceived as overly privacy-intrusive,\" Armstrong says. Expect more privacy probes of algorithms in the workplace, Armstrong adds, noting that too many uses of \"artificial intelligence\" fail to live up to that billing. \"Most of the stuff we see is simple programming - a formula or algorithm which calculates something along the lines of, 'Someone with a score of 128 on this test is more likely to be a good employee who will stay,'\" he says. \"The issue here is that’s often prejudice or gut feel dressed up as science and then codified in the algorithm. Often this stuff isn’t justifiable and is discriminatory. For example, if I exclude everyone who refuses to  work on a Saturday or Sunday in my algorithm, could this exclude some people on the basis of their religion?\" Schwartz is an award-winning journalist with two decades of experience in magazines, newspapers and electronic media.

Gensler called for additional regulation and more authority from Congress to oversee markets he likened to the \"Wild West.\" At least 102 job listings on PayPal's website connect to its  , which was launched in October 2020 and incrementally expanded over the past 10 months. Some PayPal open positions focus on compliance and anti-money laundering. The new jobs are in the United States, Ireland, Israel, Singapore, Hong Kong and Guatemala. PayPal will rely on crypto engineering, program, strategy, operations and blockchain analytics managers, along with investigators, tax reporting specialists and legal directors, to support its digital money transfer service,  . On a recent   outlining Q2 earnings, PayPal confirmed it will continue expanding its cryptocurrency offerings, launching a \"super app\" wallet and expanding within the U.K. The company launched its first cryptocurrency and blockchain services in late 2020 to enable the   of bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin. This year, PayPal began allowing U.S. customers to use cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services and enabled transfers to third-party wallets. Phishing and business email campaigns designed to steal bitcoins climbed by 192% between October 2020 and April 2021, according to a recent report from  . \"As some companies started to announce that they will accept payments in bitcoin, it generated more interest in cryptocurrency and started to drive its value up,\" Barracuda Networks says. \"Cyberattacks quickly followed, with impersonation attacks growing 192% [between October 2020 and April 2021].\" Barracuda Networks warns that as the price of bitcoin has climbed, cybercriminals have \"started to come up with more sophisticated schemes to cash in on bitcoin-mania.\" Hackers have impersonated digital wallets and other cryptocurrency-related apps with fraudulent security alerts to steal login credentials. In the past, attackers impersonated financial institutions targeting banking credentials, the company notes. \"Today, they are using the same tactics to steal valuable bitcoins,\" it adds. SEC Chairman Gensler weighed in on the volatile cryptocurrency markets on Tuesday, addressing several ongoing concerns raised by both risk management and security experts. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Gensler called the cryptocurrency market \"rife with fraud, scams and abuse.\" \"We haven’t seen crypto used much as a medium of exchange,\" Gensler said. \"To the extent that it is used as such, it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions and tax collection. It also can enable extortion via ransomware, as we recently saw with  .\" The SEC chairman also observed: \"Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. … In many cases, investors aren’t able to get rigorous, balanced and complete information. If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.\" Gensler called on lawmakers to provide the SEC additional authority to regulate crypto markets: \"We need additional congressional authority to prevent transactions, products and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks. We also need more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector.\" The chairman added: \"Right now, large parts of the field of crypto are sitting astride of regulatory frameworks that protect investors and consumers, guard against illicit activity, ensure for financial stability, and yes, protect national security. At the heart of finance is trust. And at the heart of trust in markets is investor protection. If this [cryptocurrency] field is going to continue, or reach any of its potential to be a catalyst for change, we better bring it into public policy frameworks.\" As staff writer on the news desk at Information Security Media Group, Gunderman covers governmental/geopolitical cybersecurity updates from across the globe.

In a breach notification statement posted on its website, the organization says its investigation into the recent cyber incident determined that unauthorized access to its computer network occurred between May 29 and May 31. \"During this brief time period, some patient information may have been accessible, such as names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, medical record numbers and patient account numbers, as well as limited treatment information used by UF Health for its business operations,\" the organization says. The organization's   were not accessed, the statement notes. UF Health says it first detected unusual activity on computer systems May 31. \"We took immediate action to contain the event, including reporting it to law enforcement and launching an investigation with independent experts.\" \r\n The organization's UF Health Leesburg Hospital and UF Health The Villages Hospital were affected by the incident, but not UF Health Jacksonville Hospital or UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, the statement notes. \"We have no reason to believe the information was further used or disclosed,\" the organization says. But it's offering affected individuals complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. UF Health says it is taking steps to enhance the security of its electronic systems and the information it maintains. Some local news media outlets, including  , have cited unnamed UF Health insiders and reported that the UF Health incident involved ransomware and the attackers demanded a $5 million ransom. For weeks, UF Health clinicians reportedly had to rely on paper records for patient care, and some appointments were canceled or postponed as the organization shut down many of its IT systems, including electronic health records, while mitigating the incident. As of Wednesday, the UF Health Central Florida incident was not posted on the Department of Health and Human Services'   website listing health data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals. UF Health Central Florida did not immediately respond to Information Security Media Group's request for additional details about the incident. Some experts note that the Florida incident apparently is similar to a recent ransomware-related   reported by San Diego-based  . The   attack on Scripps Health resulted in networks outages, causing disruptions to EHR access for clinicians and portal access for patients, for weeks during the recovery. It also caused the cancellation and postponement of patient appointments. Like UF Health Central Florida, Scripps Health said its EHR system was not compromised in the incident. Scripps Health also reported a data breach resulting from the incident, with 147,000 individuals’ data affected. Several lawsuits have been filed against Scripps Health in recent weeks (see:  ). \"Challenges created by legacy systems, lack of documentation, backup restoration times, etc., can all contribute to the recovery process being much longer and more complicated than anticipated - and, in a healthcare environment, that can put lives at risk,\" notes Brett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft.  While advance planning for potential cyberattacks is key to minimizing downtime, it’s critical that those plans be periodically tested, Callow notes. \"Running tabletop exercises will enable providers to identify shortcomings and improve their strategies accordingly,\" he says. \"You don’t want to wait until your plan has been put into action to discover it has big problems.\"  and investigations attorney   of the law firm Otterbourg P.C. notes: \"UF Health’s long-haul tribulations in the wake of the cyberattack are, unfortunately, typical among the unprepared. This is especially so in the healthcare sector, which is a prime target right now.\" Moran advises his clients to use a business continuity plan checklist \"to identify the critical elements of the business so as to develop a framework of action in response to a disabling crisis event.\" From this, he says, an organization can \"establish a business continuity plan with the aim of both minimizing the likelihood in the first instance of a business disruption, such as a cybercrime encryption of systems, and setting forth the process by which the business will respond to such an event to maintain operation.\" McGee is executive editor of Information Security Media Group's HealthcareInfoSecurity.com media site.

And so, fast-moving cyber-attacks continue to rapidly outpace the human teams responsible for mitigating their impact – often with devastating consequences. This calls for a radical revision to cyber-security, that is, a shift from pre-empting external threats, siloed solutions and signature-based tools, to understanding ‘normal’ across the digital enterprise and responding to malicious patterns of behavior with AI.

Spanning insider threats and nonstop data breaches, to the latest business-efforts to arrest fraud, malicious insiders and advanced hack attacks, and much more, we have you covered.   As a media sponsor of Infosecurity Europe 2019, ISMG was at the center of the dialogue both at and around the event.  Once again, we returned to the Infosecurity Europe show floor with an open studio amidst the exhibitors and myriad attendees. Sitting down with dozens of the industry’s leading vendors, practitioners and influencers, we gathered expert insight into the cybersecurity topics and strategies that matter most today. All told, we conducted more than 40 exclusive video interviews with a selection of the industry's top thought leaders, including CEOs, CISOs, analysts, researchers and educators.  Conference keynote speaker Troy Hunt, founder of the Have I Been Pwned? service, analyzed for us the nonstop rise of data breaches. Distinguished security researchers – including Raj Samani, Chester Wisniewski and Tod Beardsley – detailed the latest threats and how business must respond. Other leading technology thinkers shared the latest on business adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the quest to block privileged account takeovers and phishing attacks, techniques for securing supply chains, and among many other topics, digital transformation, automation, DevSecOps as well as the growing use of red teams and bug bounties. As the preeminent cybersecurity conference in the region, Infosecurity Europe again cemented its reputation as being the place where those in Europe and the United Kingdom come to talk cybersecurity.\r\nDive into the pages that follow for highlights from the discussion. Information Security Media Group (ISMG) is the world's largest media company devoted to information security and risk management. Each of its 28 media sites provides relevant education, research and news that is specifically tailored to key vertical sectors including banking, healthcare and the public sector; geographies from North America to Southeast Asia; and topics such as data breach prevention, cyber risk assessment and fraud.

And in the age of GDPR and CCPA, you’d best have a handle on data discovery and classification. Patrick Benoit of CBRE gives the BISO's perspective on data risk governance.\n                                    • \n                                   5G technology reminds us that, globally, our sensitive data is open to attack. Janine Darling, founder and CEO of STASH Secure Data, is committed to resolving that vulnerability challenge.\n                                    • \n                                   You can see it in the latest high-profile attacks: Security requirements are ever more complex, exceeding the capacity of current protection capabilities. Enterprises need a new strategy for defending entry points, and Tom Sego of BlastWave believes he has it.\n                                    • \n                                   The latest edition of the ISMG Security Report features highlights from RSA Conference 2021 conference, including the emphasis on \"resilience.\"\n                                    • \n                                   CISOs should democratize cybersecurity by making all the stakeholders accountable, says Arwa Alhamad, cybersecurity director at Saudi Telecom Co.\n                                    • \n                                   SOC automation capabilities need to be enhanced to go beyond performing routine tasks, says Abdullah Al-Attas, head of cybersecurity at PLUS Malaysia.\n                                    • \n                                   Although many companies are deploying extended detection and response, or XDR, their efforts often are coming up short, says Richard Stiennon, chief research analyst at IT-Harvest.\n                                    • \n                                   As a global CISO and privacy officer, Rebecca Wynn has earned her stripes. And she's upfront with her expectations: She will take your security organization to the next level. But she also won't hesitate to walk away if she sees that cybersecurity commitment is nothing but talk.\n                                    • \n                                   How can healthcare organizations, which have  been considered technology laggards, now become leaders? CISO Mitch Parker recommends that they implement technology - including security solutions - as part of a broader business strategy.\n                                    • \n                                   Security researchers who track ransomware often think such attacks must have hit their peak and can't get any worse - but then they do, thanks to top gangs continually improving the sophistication of their criminal enterprises, say McAfee's Raj Samani and John Fokker.\n                                    • \n                                   Nastassja Finnegan, CSO of First National Bank South Africa, says that the key to creating a strong culture of security in an organization is providing the right security context - and failure to do so results in pushback.\n                                    • \n                                   While ransomware attacks are largely viewed as cybersecurity incidents, there are critical data privacy concerns that must always be top of mind, says Jodi R. Daniels, founder and CEO of privacy consultancy Red Clover Advisors.\n                                    • \n                                   Attorney Ann Marie Mortimer shares tips on reducing liability in the event of a data breach and how ordinary security team communications, standard incident response reports and bug bounty payments can make a bad situation even worse.\n                                    • \n                                   The ransomware challenge facing organizations today traces directly to the success being enjoyed by gangs who wield such malware, says Palo Alto Networks' Jen Miller-Osborn, who describes new strategies to help disrupt this cybercrime business model, including the launch of the new Ransomware Task Force.\n                                    • \n                                   What are the top cybercrime trends and threats coming up, and what should organizations be doing now to best prepare? Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson describes threats that are likely to emerge and intensify by 2030 and what security steps all organizations should be taking now.\n                                    • \n                                   Cybersecurity professor Ron Woerner defines “unfluence” as the negative side of influence. He describes the principles of influence and psychology and how black hat hackers use them on their victims - and how to defend against these tactics.\n                                    • \n                                   Toby Gouker of First Health Advisory discusses how to improve the security of \"medical internet of things\" devices in this video interview.\n                                    • \n                                   Michael Oberlaender of LogMeIn discusses describes authentication methods that businesses can use to support the permanent \"work from anywhere\" model.\n                                    • \n                                   Roger Sels of BlackBerry believes our approach to cybersecurity is broken. In this interview, he explains how security leaders can safeguard their organizations more effectively by resetting the status quo.\n                                    • \n                                   Allen Phelps, CEO of the security firm Trust Farm, reviews some of the tactics, techniques and procedures used by foreign influence threat actors to target research organizations and shares some best practices to defend against those threats.\n                                    • \n                                   In the wake of recent attacks on supply chains and critical infrastructure, Adrian Mayers says it's time for cybersecurity to be seen as an issue of national defense, and that cybersecurity leaders throughout the private and public sectors must embrace their role to protect national interests.\n                                   Need help registering? \n                     \n                 Complete your profile and stay up to date Need help registering? \n                 \n               Need help registering? \n                 \n               Our website uses cookies.

For fraudsters, these shifts have presented myriad new opportunities for illicit financial gain. Fraud is big business, and business is good.  However, the arms race continues– technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are evolving to mitigate machine speed attacks, while behavioral biometrics and strong authentication are proving to be powerful responses to schemes such as account takeover and synthetic identity fraud. Fraud may have changed, but so have the countermeasures.  What were the top forms of fraud impacting financial services in 2020? Where’s fraud anticipated to expand in 2021? And, which specific anti-fraud controls will organizations invest in to improve their defenses in the coming year?

Yet, what have we done to improve our visibility and reduce the critical lag time between incident detection and mitigation? Attacks such as SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline show that adversaries are not only stealthy, persistent and patient … but they also are taking advantage of our complexity – the sheer number of disparate tools, vendors and over-burdened staff that enterprises have cobbled together for defense, leaving dangerous gaps in detection and response. How can one reduce this complexity? What are effective strategies for reducing the number of vendors, simplifying the stack, integrating disparate tools and gaining that single, complete view of threats?

This edition of CyberEd APAC features an interview with Brijesh Singh, inspector general of police for cyber in Maharashtra, who outlines the challenges in investigating breaches and the new technologies that are playing an important role, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. He stresses that organizations need to have \"baseline controls\" in place as well as a risk management framework to help prevent breaches. \"You need to have an intelligence framework in association with law enforcement, wherein the dark web is trawled regularly for information which is relevant to you,\" he explains. Also featured in this edition is an interview with Minatee Mishra, a security specialist at Philips, who tackles the topic of managing IoT device risks. She describes \"four guiding principles\" for managing IoT devices. \"One of the ways in which you can minimize the risk is isolate these systems or have a perimeter control which is strong enough to detect any intrusions coming in,\" she says.

We caught up with Ahmad at our Toronto Cybersecurity Summit in September. Among the insights he shared: The rise of both the malicious and accidental insider threat within Canadian enterprises. \"We've seen a lot of folks reporting to us that they believe some of their own employees and staff may have been involved in some kind of a cybercrime within the organization,\" Ahmad said. At that same event, our own Tom Field had the pleasure of speaking with Kimberly Sutherland of LexisNexis Risk Solutions on the fraud threat landscape. She spoke about the spike in synthetic IDs being created to commit fraud. \"Sometimes it's a lot easier to create a fake identity than it is to actually steal a real identity,\" Sutherland said. Of course, Ahmad and Sutherland were but two of our featured speakers at this year's Toronto Summit. Their sessions and others are featured in this edition of CyberEd Magazine.

IT teams are challenged with monitoring cloud services and mission-critical applications by separate tools which lead to swivel chair approaches, runaway costs, and fragmented operational data getting trapped in siloed tools. This creates blind spots that halt teams’ ability to quickly detect and resolve issues, and negatively impacts customer experiences. What if there was a way to unify monitoring and investigation across the entire cloud stack? Wouldn’t the jobs of cloud architects and system administrators be so much easier if there were consolidated views enabling faster mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) and mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR)?

Attackers launching a greater number of less-than-obvious attacks. This was the message delivered by Andy Bates of the Global Cyber Alliance at ISMG's London Cybersecurity Summit this past October. \"We think that one of the trends going forward into the future is that a larger number of smaller-value crimes will go below the radar and therefor avoid detection by law enforcement,\" Bates said. Also in London, we discussed digital transformation with Stephen Owen, CISO at Bourne Leisure Group - who's now leading his third such initiative. His biggest lesson learned? \"It's not about tooling; it's about the people, and it's bringing those people along the journey and getting them educated that this is the new paradigm shift.\" Bates and Owen were two of our featured speakers at this year's London event.

In an update, Gartner recently issued a new strategic road map for SASE adoption that emphasizes the need for a detailed migration plan (see:  ). By 2024, Gartner predicts, at least 40% of enterprises worldwide will have explicit strategies for adopting SASE, up from 10% in 2020. Many CISOs tell me the biggest roadblock to implementing SASE is demonstrating the value. And that requires carefully defining the SASE operating model and how it supports, for example, a remote workforce.  “I am excited about the possibilities that SASE brings, as clearly articulated in the report, and I am sure it will be disruptive enough to get enterprises to transition to the digital bandwagon and reap benefits faster,”  , group CISO of Biocon, a large biopharmaceutical company based in Bengaluru, tells me. He says the SASE model will help address data visibility and control issues as enterprises move to the cloud. \"However, CISOs need to bring in changes in operational procedures to take advantage of the centralized control and enforcement mechanisms that come with the implementation of SASE,\" he says.  Nat Smith, senior research director at Gartner, tells me: \"One of the biggest drivers has been the acceleration [to remote work] from the pandemic and boards of directors asking CISOs, 'What are you going to do differently now?'\" Rajpreet Kaur, senior principal analyst at Gartner, says SASE helps in binding the user's identity to the data context, the location, and the types of devices used to access the data to improve authentication.  Many CISOs and security teams now believe that SASE will help them use existing resources efficiently to address the remote access environment and enhance operational efficiency.  , vice president of global security at Concentrix, tells me that the \"work from home\" shift has accelerated the adoption of SASE, which is being used to replace VPNs. SASE is being expanded to include antivirus and patch management at the end-user machines, he says. One of the world's top 10 banks, which used VPN for fast internet access, now uses SASE to go direct-to-net with improved user experience, safely bypassing the VPN, notes Neil Thacker, CISO of Netskope. Gartner published its report introducing the SASE concept,  , in August 2019. \r\n\r\n After the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide shift to a largely remote workforce, interest in SASE grew, prompting Gartner to release its update,  , in April. The latest report says that to adopt SASE, CISOs need a migration strategy that contains the following components:  Gartner's analysts say that \"work from anywhere\" and cloud-based computing have accelerated cloud-delivered SASE offerings to enable anywhere, anytime secure access from any device. Security and risk management leaders should build a migration plan from the legacy perimeter and hardware-based offerings to a SASE model. One hindrance to SASE adoption, some security experts tell me, is that organizations lack visibility into sensitive data and awareness of threats. Too many enterprises have separate security and networking teams that don't share information and lack an all-encompassing security strategy, they say.  \"While the vendors are touting SASE as the end-all solution, the key to success would depend upon how well we define the SASE operating model, particularly when there are so many vendors coming up with SASE-based solutions,\" says Bengaluru-based  , senior vice president and head of the information security services group at Wells Fargo.  , CISO of Indian Oil Corp., says that as data centers move to the cloud, companies need to use SASE to enhance security while controlling costs. Along with Gartner, some practitioners believe that moving to a SASE model could, indeed, help cut operational costs over the long term and close security gaps, making it easier to secure assets in the cloud. And those factors are clearly fueling the movement to SASE.  Nandikotkur is an award-winning journalist with over 20 years of experience in newspapers, audiovisual media, magazines and research.

The new BlackMatter ransomware-as-a-service operation announced its launch last month via Russian-language cybercrime forums. \"The project has incorporated in itself the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit,\" a user with the handle \"BlackMatter\" claimed in July 19 posts, threat intelligence firm   reported (see:  ). Although ransomware operators love bluster, the BlackMatter operation, indeed, looks to have been spawned from at least one prior ransomware effort.   reports that it was able to obtain a decryptor from a BlackMatter victim and share it with ransomware-hunting expert Fabian Wosar, CTO of security firm Emsisoft, for review. Wosar told the publication that numerous shared characteristics between the BlackMatter and DarkSide code means it's extremely likely they're the same. \"After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here,\" Wosar tweeted on Saturday. \"Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.\" A copy of BlackMatter ransomware has also been uploaded by McAfee scientist Christiaan Beek to cybercrime tracking site Abuse.ch's  , leading to other security firms also verifying that it's a rebranding of DarkSide. After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar)  \"We have seen some indication that currently suggests that at least one actor connected to some DarkSide ransomware operations is aligning themselves with BlackMatter,\" Kimberly Goody, director of financial crime analysis at Mandiant, tells Bleeping Computer. As that careful phrasing suggests, seeing someone attack organizations with reskinned DarkSide - now called BlackMatter - doesn't mean that the DarkSide operation, per se, has resurfaced. Instead, one or more individuals possess the code - and, seemingly, the ability to generate both encryptors and decryptors. DarkSide was run as a ransomware-as-a-service operation, which refers to a business model in which operators supply crypto-locking malware to affiliates. The affiliates then use the malware to infect networks and share in any ransom paid by a victim. Experts say it's common for affiliates to keep 70% of ransoms, with 30% going to operators. But it's not clear if whoever now has the DarkSide code helped found or run that operation, or if they were an affiliate or obtained the code via other means. What is clear: Ransomware operations were making money hand over fist, seemingly with nothing to stop them, until the DarkSide operation hit Colonial Pipeline Co. on May 7, disrupting fuel deliveries to much of the U.S. East Coast. Security experts have told me that the DarkSide affiliate that hit Colonial Pipeline probably didn't even really understand what the organization did. Regardless, news of the attack provided a clear reminder to the world: Mess with Americans' gas tanks at your peril. The Biden administration has moved to more aggressively counter the ransomware business model, including by threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin that if he doesn't crack down on criminals operating from inside his country's borders, then the U.S. reserves the right to do so. With the caveat that criminals lie, DarkSide blamed the Colonial Pipeline hit on an affiliate. This was disingenuous because DarkSide was a ransomware-as-a-service operation, meaning most - if not all - infections using DarkSide's malware would have been done by affiliates. \"In the affiliate model of ransomware, the affiliates are like contractors that you're responsible for,\" says Bob McArdle, director of cybercrime research at Trend Micro. \"They're not quite like your core group. But they're still people that you're responsible for. And if they go off and do things that are outside your rules, just like in the real world, there's a certain amount of repercussions on you as the company that hired them, for want of a better word.\" After Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million ransom to DarkSide, the operation reported on May 13 that its infrastructure was being disrupted, and it said it would  . Unusually, the FBI also managed to  . \"In view of the above and due to the pressure from the U.S., the affiliate program is closed. Stay safe and good luck,\" DarkSide reportedly said on its data leak site. \"The landing page, servers and other resources will be taken down within 48 hours.\" The return of DarkSide's code being used in attacks comes as no surprise. Security experts to whom I've spoken in recent weeks said they expected any operations that supposedly announced their retirement to quickly return to the fray with a new name and fresh branding. Likewise, affiliates typically work with multiple ransomware operations - often at the same time - meaning that if one closes up shop, many more remain. Last week, for example, Wosar reported that at least one organization had suffered a fresh attack via the REvil - aka Sodinokibi - ransomware. The group behind that operation went quiet last month, following the July 2 attack it unleashed via  , infecting about 60 of its managed service provider customers and up to 1,500 of their clients' systems. Kudos for Kaseya, however, in that it has   - the company says it paid no ransom - and has been helping victims decrypt their files. Whether REvil has made a comeback or someone else has obtained its code is not yet clear. Yet another example concerns the DoppelPaymer - aka DopplePaymer - operation, which in May stopped posting new victims to its website. But now, the group is back in a new form, rebranded as Grief - for \"pay or grief\" (see:  ). The impetus for the name change is apparently the operator attempting to trick victims into paying it a ransom, despite the operation having been   maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control in 2019, says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft. \"DoppelPaymer is a product of Evil Corp, and Evil likely launched and transitioned to the Grief brand either so organizations would not realize they are breaking OFAC sanctions when paying or, perhaps, to provide them with plausible deniability,\" he tells me. So while ransomware operations may sometimes claim to retire or pause their attacks, security experts tracking their crypto-locking code in the wild often tell a different story.

This change has driven many to adopt a   framework, which is based on the concept that no device or user can be trusted to access resources until that device or user has been validated to be secure.  As it stands now, however, attackers are taking advantage of a visibility gap to execute more advanced cyberattacks. Organizations need to take Zero Trust to the next level by implementing an advanced cloud access security broker, or  , solution that solves many of the challenges presented by the hybrid work environment.  In order to understand how this is done, it’s important to first understand the challenges that all organizations, regardless of size or industry, are now facing. In order to make sure data isn’t being mishandled, knowingly or unknowingly, every organization should implement data loss prevention, or  , policies. This will enable them to automatically classify, protect and encrypt sensitive data and help ensure its integrity.  Employees now expect to be able to access company data from any device. To keep up with this expectation, most organizations allowed access to the infrastructure from personal and unmanaged devices. This introduced a high volume of risk as these devices haven’t been protected by a security solution and could introduce malware into the infrastructure. The right CASB solution will enable your organization to dial in dynamic access policies. Contextual signals such as location, device type and user behavior will ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data. This is a key part of stopping attacks before they happen. Especially on personal mobile devices, attackers have a myriad of ways to deliver phishing attacks and malicious content. Socially engineered campaigns that target individuals across social, gaming and even dating platforms entice employees to share login credentials or download malicious applications that give attackers a backstage pass to your infrastructure.  Without visibility into the context under which devices and users access corporate data, many organizations are missing telltale signs of a compromised account, such as anomalous login location or massive file exfiltration. User and entity behavior analytics, or  , is an important part of CASB that will help organizations identify and protect against anomalous behavior that’s indicative of a  .  To get the most out of their cloud apps and infrastructure without putting data at risk, organizations need to know everything that’s going on and how it’s happening. They also need to be able to detect and respond to threats. Implementing a CASB solution will provide full visibility into the interactions between users, endpoints, cloud apps and data. It also will enable an organization to dynamically dial in Zero Trust access controls. The challenges that come with enabling employees for remote work are here to stay, and attackers will only continue to evolve their tactics in response to that. Keeping a step ahead of them by leveraging an advanced CASB solution is one of the most straightforward ways to keep your organization safe and out of the headlines. Learn more about Lookout CASB  .

The use of data across broad areas of industry and services is at the core of the digital economy, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence are transforming international trade, highlighting the economic, social and political stakes as well as the potential cybersecurity risks, she says. “These technologies are going to broaden the range of services that can be provided remotely and cheaply, even overseas,\" Russ says. \"So people are talking about surgeries provided remotely overseas, across national borders, across oceans. … It won’t be long before a lot of white-collar workers whose jobs have been relatively insulated from import competition … will also be facing a lot more global competition in the coming years.\" In this episode of \"Cybersecurity Unplugged,\" she discusses: Russ specializes in open-economy macroeconomics and international trade policy. She's a professor of economics at the University of California, Davis; a faculty research associate for the National Bureau of Economic Research's International Trade and Investment Program; and a co-organizer of the International Trade and Macroeconomics workshops.

That started his crusade to figure out how to teach machines to find and fix those flaws, which led to him creating Mayhem. Mayhem is a machine that applies patching and continuous penetration testing autonomously and in real time. “Mayhem has helped [companies] do two things: Every time we say there’s a bug, we prove it, and the second is we help them better test their software to make sure good stuff works … as well as that no bad things can occur. And Mayhem automates both,” he says. In this episode of \"Cybersecurity Unplugged,\" Brumley discusses: David Brumley is the CEO of ForAllSecure, a cybersecurity company whose products are based on the Mayhem machine. He is also a researcher in software security, network security and applied cryptography.

In May, XSS and Exploit each banned any discussion related to ransomware and ransomware as a service. And the moderators deleted older conversations on the topic in an effort to avoid any confrontation with law enforcement agencies, Digital Shadows says. The operators hoped the ban would alleviate a focus on the forums by the federal government and law enforcement agencies as a result of the disruptive ransomware attack by DarkSide on   in June and  's attack on the remote management software company Kaseya.  DarkSide and REvil had representatives operating on each forum, the report notes. 's attack on Colonial Pipeline temporarily disrupted fuel deliveries to much of the East Coast, while REvil's attack affected 60 of  's managed service provider customers and up to 1,500 of their clients.   Once the two forums' ransomware chatter ban was in place, accounts belonging to REvil and DarkSide were banned by XSS and Exploit. Soon after, accounts by the gang Avaddon also were banned, the report says. Many of XSS and Exploit's forum members applauded the ban on ransomware, calling the activity immoral, Digital Shadows says. But others took an opposing view.  \"Many forum users had called for ransomware to be banned even before this ruling, particularly after a woman died in Germany after the hospital treating her fell victim to a ransomware attack in September 2020,\" Digital Shadows says. \"However, many other users reacted negatively, dismissing 'the morality police' and predicting that the forums would suffer without the revenue generated through the ransomware trade.\"  Digital Shadows points out that many darknet forum members are not inclined to follow any rules, much less those imposed by a forum. This has proven true for XSS and Exploit, because the ban has led threat actors to try different methods of communication as a workaround, the threat intelligence firm reports. \"It seems that as long as ransomware representatives refrain from using the word 'ransomware' in their posts, they are allowed to stand,\" Digital Shadows notes.  The forums' moderators, however, are attempting to control what is said and have blocked certain users who have broken the rules, such as by discussing or advertising ransomware-as-a-service offerings, according to the threat intelligence firm's report.  \"While the trade in ransomware-related services has largely disappeared from the cybercriminal forums that implemented the ban, we have still seen threads discussing ransomware-related issues, such as what to do with system accesses previously destined for ransomware affiliates, speculation about potential law enforcement involvement in ransomware campaigns, cooperation between national law enforcement agencies in counter-ransomware operations and predictions about the future of ransomware,\" the report notes.  In some cases, the forum operators are allowing smaller violations to continue, Digital Shadows says.  \"This strict approach isn't universal, though, and not all new ransomware-related posts are being flagged,\" the report states. \"For example, one forum member shared a link to the Himalaya RaaS recruitment page with no negative consequences. We have also seen users sharing Petya ransomware source code and advertising a Chaos ransomware builder, a Thanos ransomware builder and decryptor, and a GitHub submission for Ryuk ransomware.\" This could indicate that other forum members don't bother reporting possible violations or the moderators don't have the time and bandwidth to respond to all offending content.  Digital Shadows also says that, eventually, the forum operators will simply ignore their own regulations and allow ransomware conversations to resume. This is the case with numerous other \"rules\" on cybercriminal platforms, the analysts say.\r\n Meanwhile, Digital Shadows says that many ransomware attackers have shifted away from these two forums to use other sites.  \"Ransomware groups may also be using other platforms to recruit, e.g., private messaging applications,\" the team says, pointing to the darknet forum   as one such newly created criminal resource.

The FDIC, which deploys nearly 4,600 smartphones and more than 150 tablets to its employees and contractor personnel, was only partially effective in awareness training, billing analysis and configuration management, according to the audit, which covered the period from July 2019 to April 2021. But the reports says it implemented effective controls in the areas of asset management, incident response and data protection. OIG auditors made nine recommendations to the FDIC. For example, it recommended the agency: The FDIC concurred with all nine OIG recommendations and plans to complete corrective actions by May 30, 2022. The FDIC's mobile security policies, procedures and guidance, the report finds, did not reflect current business practices, nor did they mirror important NIST guidance. The agency did not properly implement a BYOD program or adequately address the risks associated with personal use of FDIC-furnished devices, the report notes.  In May 2019, the FDIC began allowing its bank examiners the option of using personal smartphones for work, the report notes. The FDIC developed a set of \"frequently asked questions\" about BYOD security requirements, but it failed to adopt a written policy, it adds. In addition, the agency has not defined \"acceptable use\" of mobile applications, and many employees have downloaded non-work-related apps, the OIG audit determined. That creates a security risk because some apps can track, access and share a user's activity for third-party use. The report also states that the FDIC's logging and monitoring practices were not guided by written procedures and did not provide for adequate separation of duties. \"The absence of written procedures for reviewing audit logs increased the operational risk associated with staff turnover because [the agency's Division of Information Technology] was dependent on the knowledge and experience of a key administrator to perform this function,\" the report states. The OIG report says the agency did not test software updates for its mobile devices before users downloaded and installed them. \"The approach presents an operational risk that users will install a software update that causes a widespread IT interoperability issue,\" auditors say. For example, the report says that after an OS software update was installed in certain smartphones in 2019, some users were not able to sync their device's mobile hot spot capabilities to the agency's network on their work laptops. That's because the software was not fully compatible with the software on the FDIC's laptops. \"Had [the agency] completed its functional testing before allowing users to download the software update, [it] could have identified and remediated the hot spot connectivity issue before users started calling the help desk,\" the OIG states. Auditors recommended the FDIC configure its MDM solution to prevent users from downloading and installing updates until they are properly tested. Although the agency has since implemented a three-day download/install delay to allow time for testing, auditors say the change has not been reflected in the FDIC's policies. Although the FDIC requires employees to complete annual information security and privacy training, auditors found the program contained limited information on mobile device threats, including the use of unsecured public Wi-Fi, and how to identify suspicious activity. The auditors recommend adherence to NIST's Mobile Threat Catalog. The OIG report says the FDIC also did not routinely report usage information for its mobile devices and mobile Wi-Fi hot spot routers to business units - including information on zero usage - potentially presenting a wider attack surface. The FDIC's CIO and CPO, Sylvia Burns, wrote to the OIG, concurring with the findings. \"The issues identified in the report represent opportunities for the FDIC to improve the mobile device management program and better ensure policies and procedures are applied consistent with OMB policy, NIST guidance, and internal security policies,\" Burns wrote. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment further on the OIG's findings.

One calls for imposing sanctions against countries that allow   to operate within their borders. Another would require law enforcement agencies to better track cybercrime statistics to identify trends.   On Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the senior member of the committee, introduced the  .  In addition to calling for sanctions against governments that allow cybercriminals to operate, the bill would establish cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure and create new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. \"The most important part of this bill is the sections highlighting the fact that ransomware groups are operating with impunity in locations owned by governments that are providing a safe harbor from international law enforcement and the direction to develop regulatory actions around cryptocurrency,\" says Austin Berglas, who formerly was an assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations at the FBI's New York office. Berglas, now the global head of professional services at cybersecurity firm BlueVoyant, also notes that the part of the bill that calls for cryptocurrency exchanges to better monitor suspicious transactions and adhere to know-your-customer standards would help the FBI and other law enforcement agencies track virtual currency used in ransomware extortion attempts. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and the Senate has introduced legislation called the  , which would require the Justice Department and the FBI to compile more detailed statistics about cybercrime as well as develop a taxonomy to help contextualize and sort this data. \"What we do not measure, we cannot fix. By improving reporting on cybercrime, this bill is the first step toward fighting back against a massive scourge afflicting consumers, communities and our economy,\" says Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., one of several senators co-sponsoring the bill. Congress is already considering several other proposals to help counter cyberthreats that have been introduced in the aftermath of the supply chain attack against  , intrusions against vulnerable   servers conducted by groups connected to China and ransomware attacks that targeted critical infrastructure, such as the attack on  For example, a federal breach notification bill sponsored by Rubio and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., would require certain organizations to report cyberattacks within 24 hours or a face a penalty (see:  ). Meanwhile, the Biden administration issued sanctions against Russia for its alleged role in the SolarWinds attacks. And this week, Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, left open the possibility of levying sanctions against China over the Exchange attacks (see:  ). Speaking at the Black Hat 2021 conference on Thursday, Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, noted that actions by Russia and China threaten the stability of the global internet. \"We are competing between two visions - one from countries like Russia, China and Iran who want to limit access and maximize control, and another from the United States and our allies who want to build and protect a free, open and secure internet,\" Mayorkas said. The bill that Rubio and Feinstein introduced this week would allow the secretary of state, in consultation with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to designate a foreign government as a \"state sponsor of ransomware\" when a country allows a cybercriminal gang to operate freely within its borders. The measure would require the president to issue sanctions against these countries. \"Our bipartisan bill provides the tools necessary to help safeguard critical infrastructure while discouraging and disrupting these criminal organizations, including the regimes who harbor them,\" Rubio says. The bill also would require the operators of cryptocurrency exchanges to report suspicious activity, such as virtual currency used as part of a ransomware extortion scheme, to regulators. And it would create cybersecurity standards for agencies and businesses that oversee critical infrastructure. Mike Hamilton, a former vice chair of the Department of Homeland Security's State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Government Coordinating Council, says some of the bill's provisions may be redundant. \"The State Department already has a reward available for information that will tie a ransomware gang to a supportive government,\" says Hamilton, now the CISO for Critical Insight. \"We already have the capability to sanction bad actors, and legislation has been previously introduced to mandate reporting of ransomware events.\" The second bill under consideration would require the FBI to integrate cybercrime statistics into the bureau's various reporting mechanisms. It would also require state and local law enforcement officials, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies, to report cybercrime numbers from their jurisdictions to the FBI. The bill also would require the Justice Department to work with the National Academy of Sciences to create a taxonomy to help researchers better study statistics related to cybercrime. Plus, the measure would require the Government Accountability Office to produce a report on the effectiveness and shortcomings of reporting cybercrime statistics. While the   requires federal agencies to report property crime to the FBI, reporting of cybercrime to the bureau from federal and local law enforcement agencies is inconsistent, says  , who is one of the co-sponsors of the House version of the bill. The measures would make those reporting standards more uniform and centralized, she says.

And yet we've seen a spate of attackers who wield ransomware - including MountLocker, LockBit, REvil and DarkMatter - sharing insights into their inclinations, motivations and tactics.   One perhaps inadvertent takeaway from their interviews is the extent to which ransomware-wielding criminals lie (see:  ).  Researchers at Cisco Talos, for example, interviewed an individual they've called \"Aleks\" who was working as an affiliate with ransomware-as-a-service operations, including LockBit. Such operations develop and offer their crypto-locking malware to affiliates via a portal. The affiliate takes the malware and infects victims. Whenever a victim pays, the operator and affiliate share in the profits. Craig Williams, director of outreach at Cisco Talos, said the biggest surprises from the interactions with Aleks involved how much he appeared to inadvertently reveal. \"The ones that really surprised us the most were the guy's insights into himself that he accidentally shared - namely, the belief that he wanted to convey that he didn't target healthcare and other targets that are ethically charged,\"   told me. \"Now, the reality was, we knew the entire time that he was targeting healthcare. But it was really interesting to see that he wanted to convey this almost Robin Hood-type view of himself - that he was really a good guy that was misunderstood and that had to struggle in life and feed his family.\" If there's a common set of \"interview with a ransomware attacker\" cliches, it's that all attackers claim to love the motherland and their families and that they use cybercrime simply as a way to put food on the table. Faced with such considerations, who among us wouldn't wield ransomware? The White House sees things differently. Although ransomware has been pummeling organizations for years, attacks in May that disrupted critical infrastructure in the U.S. and Ireland led the Biden administration to escalate efforts to eradicate this criminal business model. One such catalyst was the DarkSide RaaS operation hitting Colonial Pipeline Co., leading to a   that if he didn't crack down on criminals operating inside his border, the U.S. reserved the right to do so. In response,   appeared to go quiet.  , aka Sodinokibi, also went quiet after it hit meat-processing giant JBS - which paid it an $11 million ransom - and later remote management software firm Kaseya, leading to about 1,500 organizations getting hit with ransomware. One persistent question has been: Have the  , DarkSide and REvil operations truly gone away, or are they just going to get rebooted with new names? (See:  ) Enter a new operation called  , which claims to have \"incorporated … the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit.\" On Monday, Dmitry Smilyanets of cybersecurity firm Recorded Future's news site The Record published an   with the apparent leader of BlackMatter. Is the operation, however, simply a reboot of DarkSide or another group? \"We are familiar with the DarkSide team from working together in the past, but we are not them, although we are intimate with their ideas,\" the BlackMatter representative told Smilyanets. But security experts, including Fabian Wosar, CTO of security firm Emsisoft, report that there are  , to the extent that they appear to be the same crypto-locking malware and decryption toolsets. After looking into a leaked BlackMatter decryptor binary I am convinced that we are dealing with a Darkside rebrand here. Crypto routines are an exact copy pretty much for both their RSA and Salsa20 implementation including their usage of a custom matrix.— Fabian Wosar (@fwosar)  On Tuesday, blockchain analysis firm   added further evidence of such a relationship, reporting that, based on its analysis of the cryptocurrency wallets being used by BlackMatter, it was simply a rebrand of DarkSide. THREAD: Based on our blockchain analysis, we can confirm reports speculating that DarkSide   group has rebranded to BlackMatter. This is part of a trend in which ransomware groups shut down & reemerge with new names, often after law enforcement actions or media scrutiny— Chainalysis (@chainalysis)  It's useful to highlight exactly how and why attackers might lie, beyond trying to dodge White House reprisals. For example, many operations now claim to have stolen data when they begin extorting victims, to increase the pressure to pay. But not all such claims are true, and when they are, sometimes the stolen data is relatively worthless. Ransomware incident response firm Coveware, for example, reported that near the end of 2020, it was seeing a rise in attackers falsely claiming to have stolen data before they crypto-locked systems. Attackers may make such claims when first attempting to extort a victim, but before they have posted the victim's name to a data leak site or published samples of stolen data. The takeaway for victims who are considering paying a ransom in part because of stolen data is that data theft claims should never be trusted without proof. But many attackers have ways of sidestepping any requests for proof. For example, \"Dissent,\" who runs the DataBreaches.net blog, reported earlier this year that the   operation told her that it never provided copies of stolen data to victims as it \"violates our privacy policy,\" whatever that means. But REvil did say it would share screenshots of directories showing stolen data. Of course, attackers could easily have taken such a screenshot without actually stealing any underlying data. Dissent said the operation also didn't hesitate to lie in the quest to receive a ransom payment. In one excerpt of a chat between a REvil victim and a REvil \"customer support\" worker, for example, the victim asked if data had been stolen. \"We took your data,\" REvil responded. The victim then chose to pay REvil a bitcoin ransom worth $25,000 - negotiated down from $50,000 - with the understanding that the attackers would share a directory listing showing which files had been stolen, Dissent said. After asking for this information again post-payment, REvil's support representative changed their tune, telling the victim: \"We did not take any data from you.\" Clearly, ransomware attackers routinely   or use fuzzy math. Many groups now practice so-called  , which involves demanding one ransom for a decryptor and another for the promise that stolen data will be deleted - if indeed any data was even stolen in the first place. Last year, Coveware warned that \"unlike negotiating for a decryption key, negotiating for the suppression of stolen data has no finite end,\" and it was likely attackers would never delete such data. In the case of REvil, it noted some victims who paid were extorted a second time - with a repeat threat to leak stolen data unless they paid more. Attackers, however, keep looking to gain any potential edge for reaching a payday. Some have taken to using so-called triple extortion -  adding distributed denial-of-service attacks to further disrupt a victim - or even  , in which they contact a breached organization's customers or business partners to tell them about the attack. Perhaps it should go without saying that ransomware attackers spin their version of reality to make themselves look as good as possible. In the fallout from the Colonial Pipeline hit, for example, DarkSide's administrators blamed an affiliate for poor target selection. But this is disingenuous in the extreme. \"If you think about it, in the affiliate model of ransomware, the affiliates are like contractors that you're responsible for,\"  , director of cybercrime research at Trend Micro, tells me. \"They're not quite like your core group. But they're still people that you're responsible for, and if they go off and do things that are outside your rules, just like in the real world, there's a certain amount of repercussions on you as the company that hired them, for want of a better word.\" BlackMatter, meanwhile, claims that it will vet all targets before affiliates are allowed to unleash crypto-locking malware. BlackMatter's supposed list of rules on its site states that \"we do not attack\" a long list of entity types, including hospitals, critical infrastructure, oil and gas firms, defense contractors, nonprofit organizations or government agencies. But don't forget to read the small print: \"If your company is on that list you can ask us for free decryption.\" So while the operation claims that it will practice exceptional care when picking targets, in fact, what it appears to be saying is that lots of organizations are going to get hit, and if yours falls into one of the aforementioned categories, it will consider sharing a \"free\" decryption tool. Of course, that's a different scenario, because recovering from a ransomware hit can take months, if not years. Ireland, for example, literally deployed the army to help roll out new systems for its health service after it was hit by Conti ransomware. Sure, Conti gave it a \"free decryptor.\" But the attack led to weeks, if not months, of unnecessary disruption, putting lives in danger. The obviously better approach, of course, would be to not hit organizations with ransomware in the first place. But for so many criminals, whatever their claims or supposed rules, this remains a step too far - even if they might claim otherwise.

Symantec reports that the campaign was active from November 2020 to March this year and targeted a water company, a power company, a communications company and a defense organization. The attackers used different techniques such as deploying malicious apps, search order hijacking and exploiting vulnerabilities in a Google Chrome Frame plug-in designed for Internet Explorer. Once successful compromising the systems, the attackers proceeded to credential theft and then collected information about the victim's SCADA systems. SCADA comprises software and hardware that allows industrial organizations to control industrial processes locally or remotely, as well as monitor and gather real-time data. Symantec reports that \"There are some indications that the attacker behind this campaign is based in China,\" based on \"certain artifacts found on the victim machines,\" but it did not provide further details and went on to say that, \"with the current information available, Symantec cannot attribute the activity to a known actor.\"  The report adds,  \"We did not observe the attackers exfiltrating data from the infected machines. However, the machine the attackers were on did have tools on it that indicate it may have been involved in the design of SCADA systems, indicating this is something the attacker may have been interested in.\" To target the unidentified water company, the attackers used a legitimate free multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini to load a malicious DLL. The malware then loaded several ProcDump hacking tools for credential theft.\r\n In the case of the power company, the attackers deployed the same PotPlayer malware and ProcDump. However, in addition to this strain, the attackers also leveraged another unidentified payload, the report notes. When targeting a victim in the communication sector, the attackers leveraged Google Chrome Frame to deploy malware and collect the victim's data. \"In the defense organization we once again saw PotPlayer Mini exploited for DLL search order hijacking, as well as seeing some file overlaps between this organization and the communications and water companies,\" the report says. Chinese espionage activities have targeted several victims in recent months. These include attacks against corporations, political figures, government officials, law enforcement agencies, political activists and dissidents of interest to the Chinese government. For instance, on Tuesday, security firm Cybereason uncovered a Chinese advanced persistent threat group that compromised telecommunication network providers across Southeast Asia in an effort to harvest customers' sensitive communications (see:  ). In a U.S. Senate hearing this week, senators and those testifying said that China is stealing IP through espionage campaigns to support its efforts to dominate technology development, such as for artificial intelligence and semiconductors. It was suggested that China could leverage this technology worldwide for espionage (see:  ). Last month, the U.S. indicted four Chinese nationals connected to the nation's Ministry of State Security for an alleged hacking campaign conducted from 2011 to 2018 that targeted universities and government entities to obtain trade secrets, medical research and other intellectual property (see:  ).

But experts say disrupting ransomware will take more than diplomacy or even using offensive cyber operations to target criminal infrastructure. \n                                                                         \n                                                                         • \n                                         \n                     \n                 It was stealthy, and it was widespread.
